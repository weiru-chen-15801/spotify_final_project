[Verse 1]
What can I tell you?
When I'm with you, I'm walking on air
Watching you sleeping there, yeah
But what can't I get through?
And for everyone, everywhere
You're answering every prayer

[Chorus]
And when you're riding a wave
Oh, won't you ride that wave to me?
When you're setting your sail
Oh, can I be your seventh sea?
When you're riding a wave
Oh, when you're riding a wave

'Cause when I'm hurt
Then I'll go to your church
'Cause when I'm hurt

Trouble In Town,Coldplay,"

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town
Because they cut my brother down
Because my sister can't wear her crown
There's trouble, there's trouble in town
Blood on the beat (Oh-oh)
Oh my goodness, there's blood on the beat
Law of the jungle or the law of the street
There's blood on, there's blood on the beat

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I never get released

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Trouble in town (Oh-oh)
Because they hung my Brother Brown
Because their system just keep you down
There's trouble, there's trouble in town

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
And I get no shelter
And I get no peace
And I just get more police, eh
And I get no comfort
And I get no name
Everything is gettin' strained

[Interlude: Young Men & Police Officer Philip Nace, Chris Martin]
Best friends
What's that?
What's his name?
X (Standby, sir)
Alright, is that X your middle name?
Of course, it's on a vehicle ID, right? (There must be some way)
You gettin' smart? 'Cause you'll be in a fucking car with him
I'm telling you
Fucking smartass (Or it's gonna kick off someday)
I'm asking you what the X is, is that your middle name?
Of course, what is it?
Don't come back with the ""What is it?"" fucking shit (There must be some way)
Talk to these fucking pigs on the street that way, you ain't talking to me that way
I don't talk to nobody in the streets, I don't hang with nobody
Well, then don't come to fucking Philadelphia, stay in Jersey
I have family out here
Everybody thinks they're a fucking lawyer and they don't know jack shit
Are you supposed to grab me like this?
Grab you up? I'll grab you any way I got to
You're not protecting me while I'm trying, while I'm trying to go to work
Why don't you shut up?

Guns,Coldplay,"

[Verse 1]
Take it from the playgrounds and take it from the bums
Take it from the hospitals and squeeze it from the slums
All the kids make pistols with their fingers and their thumbs
Advertise a revolution, arm it when it comes
We're cooking up the zeros, we've been doing all the sums
The judgment of this court is we need more guns

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop

[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everything tangled in blue
Everyone's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

[Verse 2]
Meltdown all the trumpets, all the trombones and the drums
Who needs education or A Thousand Splendid Suns?
Poor is good for business, cut the forests, they're so dumb
Only save your look-alikes and fuck the other ones
It's the opinion of this board that we need more guns

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop

[Chorus]
Everything's gone so crazy
Everybody but you
Everything's gone fucking crazy
Maybe I'm crazy too

Ah-hmm

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
Joseph rode in on a beam of light
Stray dogs to welcome him, fights, corrugate cathedrals
The sight of the pilgrims going nowhere in millions of cars

[Verse 2: Chris Martin]
Lagos a dream in the distance
From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

[Chorus: Chris Martin]
In Africa
The rivers are perfectly deep
And beautifully wide
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, ""It's alright, child
It's alright""

[Bridge]
Yeah
Ah-hmm
Ah-hmm

[Chorus: Chris Martin and Tiwa Savage, Chris Martin]
In Africa
We dance in the water and hold
Each other so tight
In Africa
The mothers will sing you to sleep
And say, ""It's alright, child

Joseph rode in on a beam of light
And dreamed of his queen by his side
There'll be a beautiful sunset
And you'll be a beautiful bride

Once he really saved my life

Sometimes I wanna call him
Say, ""Hey, let's stay up 'til morning""

You come through, you

Sweetens and mends

Raindrops back into the water

Till I'm champion of the world

(When I sail) And when I sail
I'm sailing west
(Know I might fail) Knowing I might fail
But still I'm hoping for the best

Baby, you're the best""

Waitin On You (feat. Tonk Wit Tha Gift),YNW Melly,"

[Intro]
TONK Wit Tha Gift, Gift, box full of light, light
Yung Shad, you killed this track

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
Your rejoicement to my soul, it feeds it just like oxygen
Can you hear me, Father?
Can you please send me some signs?
I've been goin' through some things, there's been a lot on my mind
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
And I will keep on praying, and I promise I'll be waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
God, I promise that I'm waitin' on you, you
I promise that I'm waitin' on you (I promise that I'm waitin')
On you (I promise that I'll wait for)
On you (I promise that I'll wait for, I promise that I'll wait for)
I'll be waiting on you, woah (I promise that I'll wait for you, I promise that I'll wait for you)
I promise I'll be waiting on you

[Verse 1: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
Jesus, I know you hear me when I pray, so I'ma keep prayin'
Had to turn my back on the devil, I couldn't keep playin'
I'm tryna make it to Heaven, and I know I'ma make it
But I gotta watch out for my soul, Lucifer tryna take it
Snakes is creepin' in the grass, I got my lawnmower
Sometimes I'm ready to die and go to Heaven, the Lord know
I just want peace in my mind, body, and my soul
And in the end, I just wanna walk the streets of gold

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
Your rejoicement to my soul, it feeds it just like oxygen
Can you hear me, Father?
Can you please send me some signs?
I've been goin' through some things, there's been a lot on my mind
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
And I will keep on praying, and I promise I'll be waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
God, I promise that I'm waitin' on you, you
I promise that I'm waitin' on you (I promise that I'm waitin')
On you (I promise that I'll wait for)
On you (I promise that I'll wait for, I promise that I'll wait for)
I'll be waiting on you, woah (I promise that I'll wait for you, I promise that I'll wait for you)
I promise I'll be waiting on you

[Verse 2: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
I don't write rhymes, I grab the pen and let my soul talk
Walkin' with Jesus, he saved my soul, this a soul walk
'Member when the only thing I used to do was sell drugs
Now my soul cryin' to the Lord, that's the real plug
Thuggin' and druggin' and stealin' cars is my history
Now my soul cryin' to the Lord, I got the victory
Was slippin' on razor blade alley, the alcohol river
Now I'm filled with the Holy Ghost and I make demons shiver

[Chorus: YNW Melly]
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
Your rejoicement to my soul, it feeds it just like oxygen
Can you hear me, Father?
Can you please send me some signs?
I've been goin' through some things, there's been a lot on my mind
Can you hear me, Jesus?
I need to hear your voice again
And I will keep on praying, and I promise I'll be waitin' on you
Waitin' on you
God, I promise that I'm waitin' on you, you
I promise that I'm waitin' on you (I promise that I'm waitin')
On you (I promise that I'll wait for)
On you (I promise that I'll wait for, I promise that I'll wait for)
I'll be waiting on you, woah (I promise that I'll wait for you, I promise that I'll wait for you)
I promise I'll be waiting on you

[Outro: TONK Wit Tha Gift]
They that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength
They shall mount up with wings as eagles
They shall run and not be weary
They shall walk and not faint
Lord, no matter what it take, no matter how long it take
I promise I'll be waiting for you, Jesus
I promise, Lord, no matter what it take

[Coro: Juanes]
Solo me llamas cuando estás sola
Enviándome mensajes a estas horas
No quiero hacerle caso a lo que rumoran
Te fuiste de borondo y te comió la aurora

[Refrán: Juanes]
Donde nos cogió la aurora yo te besé
Nos fuimos al mirador a ver amanecer
Ese brillo de tus ojos que ya no ves
Yo que estaba tan tranquilo, pero me enredé, me enredé

[Verso 1: Juanes]
Anoche te, te dejé razón cuando te llamé
Dejé el corazón, no te buscaré por la estación donde te dejé

Donde nos cogió la aurora yo te besé
Nos fuimos al mirador a ver amanecer
Ese brillo de tus ojos que ya no ves
Yo que estaba tan tranquilo, pero me enredé, me enredé

Solo me llamas cuando estás sola
Enviándome mensajes a estas horas
No quiero hacerle caso a lo que rumoran
Te fuiste de borondo y te comió la aurora

Ey, ja
Ey, ey, ma', todo bello, todo chévere (En la buena)
Lo que fue, fue, como un TBT (Sway)
Te noté picada como la DT (Skrrt)
Pegamos pa' una finca a fumar DMT (Uhh)
Reina, yo no quiero que coja la comba
Pero si la tiene que pensar, hágale en bombas (Stop)
Le conviene, sé que te me haces la tonta
Dice que no quiere, pero me tira la onda
Tus ojos me hablan, tu boca me mira
Y el momento conspira
La vibra no miente, yo sé que te trama'
Y hasta tu mama me admira
Ey, así revire y que la mala (Uh, yeah)
Hasta te marco tarjeta en la sala (Sup)
Atalaja'o y para'o en la raya, on fire!
Esto es pa' sobarle papaya (One)

Solo me llamas cuando estás sola
Enviándome mensajes a estas horas
No quiero hacerle caso a lo que rumoran

Tequila,Juanes,"

[Letra de ""Tequila""]

[Verso 1: Juanes & Christian Nodal]
Quedamos en nunca volver a hablar
Sé que no debo molestarte
Tal vez parece que estoy bien, pero no es cierto
Me tomo un trago con mi soledad
Con el segundo voy a alucinarte
Con el tercero sé que voy a emborracharme otra vez
Me prometí olvidarte y no lo pude hacer
Otra vez las ganas de llamarte me van a romper

[Coro: Juanes]
Por eso háblame, que sin tus besos
No hay tequila que pueda olvidarme de ti
Cada trago me acuerda de ti
Por eso háblame, que sin tus besos
No hay tequila que pueda olvidarme de ti
De mil formas te quiero decir: ""Te quiero"" (Ay, ay, ay)

[Verso 2: Christian Nodal]
Llegan a mi mente, de repente, tus recuerdos
Se siente bien gacho andar borracho y sin tus besos
Sale más barato superarte y yo no puedo
Quiero que regreses pa' curarme el sufrimiento

[Puente: Juanes]
Solo tú me haces ver la luna llena
Solo tú haces esta vida buena
Solo tú puedes curarme esta pena
Solo tú, liberar esta condena
Solo tú, eso no lo va a hacer nadie
Solo tú, como tu no quise a nadie
Solo tú puedes curarme esta pena
Solo tú, solo, solo tú

[Coro: Juanes & Christian Nodal]
Por eso háblame, que sin tus besos
No hay tequila que pueda olvidarme de ti
Cada trago me acuerda de ti
Por eso háblame, que sin tus besos
No hay tequila que me haga olvidarme de ti
De mil formas te quiero decir (Ay, te quiero)

Dile que ninguna ha podido superarla
Siempre trato de olvidarla, pero no hay cura

Esta loquera de luna llena
Me tiene hablando solo todo el tiempo de ella
Estas noches son tan largas
Anhelos que no dejan olvidarla
No sé qué ha pasado, ya me tiene preocupado
Ni siquiera me ha llamado y yo aquí desesperado
Buscando por todos lados una manera para verla de nuevo

Mala Manera,Juanes,"

[Letra de ""Mala Manera""]

[Intro]
Que no me vaya si te quiero
¿Qué sabes si vas a cambiar?
El problema es que no creo
Ni cuando dices la verdad

[Pre-Coro]
Ingenuidad es pensar que es bueno
Un amor que te hace sufrir
Es calmar la sed con veneno
Es bajar queriendo subir
No le echemos más leña al fuego
Es un ""Adiós"", no es un ""Hasta luego""
Y ya verás que es lo mejor para los dos

[Coro]
Te puedo querer desde aquí hasta el cielo
Me puedo quedar llorando un aguacero
No seguir en las mismas, no seguir como ayer
Con esa mala manera que tú tienes de querer
Prefiero empezar otra vez desde cero
De ahora en adelante voy a ser yo primero
No seguir en las mismas
Con esa extraña mala manera de quererme
(De quererme, de quererme, de quererme; Yeh-yeh-yeh)

[Verso 1]
Te quiero desde aquí hasta el cielo
Yo a ti te bajo un montón de estrellas
Pero aprendí a quererme a mi primero
Y no ser un preso de tus huellas
Si somos más sinceros
Y nos hacemos daño, esto se tiene que acabar

[Pre-Coro]
Ingenuidad es pensar que es bueno
Un amor que te hace sufrir
Es calmar la sed con veneno
Es bajar queriendo subir
No le echemos más leña al fuego
Es un ""Adiós"", no es un ""Hasta luego""
Y ya verás que es lo mejor para los dos

[Coro]
Te puedo querer desde aquí hasta el cielo
Me puedo quedar llorando un aguacero
No seguir en las mismas, no seguir como ayer
Con esa mala manera que tú tienes de querer
Prefiero empezar otra vez desde cero
De ahora en adelante voy a ser yo primero
No seguir en las mismas
Con esa extraña mala manera de quererme
(De quererme, de quererme, de quererme; Yeh-yeh-yeh)

Vos tienes esa faldita, todos pierden la razón
Si te está gustando mucho, te pido perdón
Y después de un vallenato, nos vamos los dos (Porque tú)""

Porque tú tienes esa cara bonita (¡Eh!)
Yo he enloquecido con tu cuerpo, ¿qué voy a hacer? (Eh)

Pa Dentro,Juanes,"

[Letra de ""Pa Dentro""]

[Verso 1]
Parece que esta vaina calentó
Tu cuerpo y mi cuerpo lo saben
Mi pecho siente tu respiración
Y los latidos son iguales

[Post-Verso]
Se te nota
Que todas tus neuronas se alborotan
Si pateo no hay quien pare esta pelota
Sudan las ventanas gota a gota
Se te nota

[Pre-Coro]
Paso a paso bajo el escalón
Donde no te pega el sol
Poco a poco paso el ecuador
Y yo quiero besarte

[Estribillo]
Ahí
Donde nace la quebrada
Ahí
En esa tierra sagrada
Ahí
Y cuando se acaben los besos
Pa'l centro y pa' dentro
Ahí
En esa playa mojada
Ahí
Tanto que me la soñaba
Ahí
Y cuando quieras que lleguemos
Pa'l centro y pa' dentro

[Refrán]

Lo que sea
Por recorrer esos caminos nuevos
Yo hago lo que sea
Lo que sea

Si tú quieres que yo mueva la cabeza
Yo la muevo
La mue- la muevo
Si tú quieres que yo mueva la cabeza
Yo la muevo
La mue- la muevo

Querer Mejor,Juanes,"

[Letra de ""Querer Mejor"" ft. Alessia Cara]

[Verso 1: Juanes, Alessia Cara, Ambos]
Aunque muy fuerte sea el aguacero
Si tú estás conmigo ya no me da miedo
Tú eres mi refugio y eres mi techo, yeah
Aunque se caiga en pedazos el cielo
O a veces el partido se sienta perdido
Y mis castillos de arena se vengan al suelo

[Pre-Coro: Juanes, Alessia Cara, Ambos]
Tú
Cuando se me ilumina la vida
Eres tú
Haciéndome saltar la pared

[Coro: Juanes, Alessia Cara, Ambos]
Amor
Te siento cerca cuando estamo' lejos
Porque te llevo aquí en mi corazón
No sé perderme de tu amor
Quizá mañana cuando estemos viejos
Y se nos arrugue un poco el corazón
Sabré querer mejor

[Interludio Instrumental]

[Verso 2: Alessia Cara]
Dicen que este amor pasa una vez en la vida
Y a veces puedo jurar que tus besos son poesía
Sincronicidad solo tú me das
Tú haces mi sueño realidad
No soy yo si no estás conmigo
Quiero verme al final contigo

[Coro: Juanes, Alessia Cara, Ambos]
Amor
Te siento cerca cuando estamos lejos
Porque te llevo aquí en mi corazón
No sé perderme de tu amor
Quizá mañana cuando estemos viejos
Y se nos arrugue un poco el corazón

Cuando te veo mi noche se hace de día
Porque viniste tú a curar lo que dolía
Como dos espejos viendo su reflejo
Tu sonrisa me da vida

Te siento cerca cuando estamos lejos
Porque te llevo aquí en mi corazón
No sé perderme de tu amor

At the right time and, baby, sometimes

Tattoos and Tequila,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
I got this one here on a midnight dare at a border town
Every time he stuck that needle in my skin, she had to look away
Had him put it right here on my chest, over my heart
That Rose of Jericho looks so good painted underneath her name
It hurt like hell, yeah, but it was worth the pain

[Chorus]
When I'm missing her, I take another shot
I know it ain't the cure, but right now, it's all I got
She took most of me, and now all that I have left
Are tattoos to remember, tequila to forget

[Verse 2]
Just another neon-rollercoaster Friday night
Bartender wiping down that bar while he keeps an eye on me
And I sure hope he ain't about to cut me off
'Cause I'm only one or two away
From getting my head where it needs to be

[Chorus]
When I'm missing her, I take another shot
I know it ain't the cure, but right now, it's all I got
She took most of me, and now all that I have left
Are tattoos to remember and tequila to forget

[Bridge]
Yeah, it hurt like hell
Mmm, but it was worth the pain

[Chorus]
When I'm missing her, I take another shot
I know it ain't the cure
When I'm missing her, I pour another shot
I know it ain't the cure, but right now, it's all I got
She took most of me, and now all that I have left
Are tattoos to remember and tequila to forget

[Outro]
Mmm, yeah

Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

[Verse 2]
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could say I never knew
Yeah, I can drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

Champagne Town,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I got there late, blame it on the rain
Guess I gotta stay another night
In this town full of lights guys like me don't like
Yeah, I flagged a yellow car, found a smoky bar
Threw this ol' heart on a stool
Let me and this 90-proof do what we gotta do

[Chorus]
So I'm here drinking whiskey in a champagne town
While you're trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

[Verse 2]
I was just a stop along the way
Just a phase you were going through
In the back of your mind, you knew
What this was coming to, yeah, so did I
But it still burns tonight just like this

[Chorus]
Whiskey in a champagne town
While you're trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

[Chorus]
Sitting here drinking whiskey in a champagne town
Are you trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now?
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

Ain't nothing but whiskey, whiskey
In a champagne town
Ain't nothing but whiskey, whiskey
In a champagne town

Some Things You Don’t Forget,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
She ain't nothin’ like the bourbon in my blood
Gets me high for a little while and then it's over
She ain't one of those move-on Mondays
Back to normal, nothin’ weighin' on ya

[Chorus]
Wish I could leave it all behind me without ever looking back
Well, she's a buzz that still runs through my head
And goodbye don't come easy with a girl like that
I swear, sometimes I wish we'd never met
Yeah, 'cause some things you don't forget

[Verse 2]
That boardwalk, neon blue shining on her lips
I still can taste that sweet Malibu on 'em
That wild in her eyes lay me down by the water
That summer-night high tide washing up on us

[Chorus]
Wish I could leave it all behind me without ever looking back
Well, she’s a buzz that still runs through my head
And goodbye don’t come easy with a girl like that
I swear, sometimes I wish we'd never met
Yeah, ’cause some things you don't forget

[Bridge]
She's a buzz that still runs through my head
No, I can't forget
No, I can’t forget
I still can taste that sweet

[Chorus]
Wish I could leave it all behind me without ever looking back
Oh, she's a buzz that still runs through my head
And goodbye don't come easy with a girl like that
Oh, I swear, sometimes I wish we'd never met
Yeah, 'cause some things you don't forget

Got What I Got,Jason Aldean,"

I said, ""You know and I know...""
You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need
I ain't playin'
What I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?""
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want

Camouflage Hat,Jason Aldean,"

You can find 'em 'bout sundown Friday
Coming outta them fields for the highway
First stop, Texaco, fill a cooler full of cold beer
Paycheck sitting on the console
Gotta get it in the bank 'fore the doors close
Call your boys, get your girl, time to throw it in another gear

Here they come, rollin' down Main Street
A country song spinnin' on a CD
Small town, lookin' for a good time
Raise a little hell and a drink at the county line
Muddy boots, muddy tires
Wrap your baby in your jacket by the fire
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they got it bad
For good ol' boys in a camouflage hat

[Verse 2]
Country girls know how to love
And how to pretty up a pickup truck
Fallin' for a rolled-up flannel under tailgate stars
And country boys, they hold 'em tight
Best believe they gonna treat 'em right
'Cause they'll be dealin' with a daddy if they break their hearts

Yeah, here they come, rollin' down Main Street
A country song spinnin' on a CD
Small town, lookin' for a good time
Raise a little hell and a drink at the county line

Lay it on the seat or up on the dashboard
Let her put it on and you'll never get it back, boy

Came Here To Drink,Jason Aldean,"

I didn't show up to cover up anything
Didn't walk through that door to forget about what's-her-name
No, I didn't have a bad day
It ain't what you think

I just came here to drink 'cause it's five o'clock

Get high on the night and the midnight glow
Sit on this barstool, live on neon time
Yeah, tonight I just came here to drink

Hear that song that puts me in a good spot

We Back,Jason Aldean,"

Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kind of red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and a Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days?
Straight up gettin' sideways

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

[Verse 2]
Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes
Getting picked up in a pickup
And kickin' it with guys like us

Dirt We Were Raised On,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we drank on it
Cranked some Hank on it
Got a little crazy, raised a little hell on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, learned to pray, learned to cuss
Throw a party, throw a punch
Ain't no hidin' where we're from

[Chorus]
It's on our boots, it's on our trucks
It was in that cloud of dust we stirred up
It was out in the fields, on them old backroads
It covers this town like it covers my soul
Yeah, it's in our bones, in our blood
Yeah, as deep as these roots run
We'll never be too far gone
From the dirt we were raised on
Dirt we were raised on

[Verse 2]
Baled some hay on it
Asked God to rain on it
We met 'em at the gate when they tried to put an interstate on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we got lost, we got found
And we got high and we got down
And every time we rolled into town

[Chorus]
It's on our boots, it's on our trucks

It was out in the fields, on them old backroads
It covers this town like it covers my soul
Yeah, it's in our bones, in our blood
Yeah, as deep as these roots run
We'll never be too far gone
From the dirt we were raised on
Dirt we were raised on

[Bridge]
Yeah, we drank on it
Cranked some Hank on it
Got a little crazy, raised hell on it

[Chorus]
It's on our boots, it's on our trucks
It was in that cloud of dust we stirred up
It was out in the fields, on them old backroads
It covers this town like it covers my soul
Yeah, it's in our bones, in our blood
Yeah, as deep as these roots run
We'll never be too far gone
From the dirt we were raised on
Dirt we were raised on

[Outro]
Yeah, it's the red stuff flying in the back of a truck bed
Goin' out as far as you can get
Windows down, turned up to a country song
That's the dirt we were raised on
Sunsets and a bullet hole stop sign
Gettin' down on a back 45
Yeah, that's how we do it all night long
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on

I Don’t Drink Anymore,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
She don't like this bar
She don't like my friends
She thinks we party too hard
She said it's me or them
She said I need to change my ways
Boy, you got a choice to make

[Chorus]
So I don't drink anymore
Ever since she left
I don't drink anymore
And I don't drink any less

[Verse 2]
She picked a bad time
To try and slow me down
And this ain't a good night
To try and turn me around
I still like to get crazy, nothing new
Still like to have a few

[Chorus]
But I don't drink anymore
Ever since she left
I don't drink anymore
And I don't drink any less

[Verse 3]
I didn't want her to go
And it's not that I don't give a damn
I just want someone to want me
For who I am
And this is who I am

[Bridge]
She said I need to change my ways
Boy, you got a choice to make

[Chorus]
So I don't drink any more
Yeah, tonight you can bet
I don't drink any more
And I don't drink any less

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I don't drink any more
And I don't drink any less

Cowboy Killer,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
She got a way of lighting up the neon, turning heads
She got a thing that turns me on, burning red
Something 'bout them blues eyes staring right back in mine
I swear I see the line

[Chorus]
She's a cowboy killer in a shotgun sea
Talkin' blonde wildfire holding onto me
She got a knock-out love and a goodbye kiss
Got that thirty-thirty smoke rolling off of her lips
Lose my breath, knock me dead every time I'm with her
Yeah, she's a cowboy killer

[Verse 2]
She make a night wild and restless, run it off the tracks
She's riding the line of crazy and reckless, and damn I love that

[Chorus]
She's a cowboy killer in a shotgun sea
Talkin' blonde wildfire holding onto me
She got a knock-out love and a goodbye kiss
Got that thirty-thirty smoke rolling off of her lips
Lose my breath, knock me dead every time I'm with her
Yeah, she's a cowboy killer

[Verse 3]
Something 'bout them blues eyes staring right back at mine
I swear I see the line

[Chorus]
She's a cowboy killer in a shotgun sea
Talkin' blonde wildfire holding onto me

Got that thirty-thirty smoke rolling off of her lips

One For The Road,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
I had one for the good, one for the bye
One for the kicking myself all night
One for her and all four wheels
And one for the way her leaving feels
Now here it is, time to close
Now how 'bout one more before I go?

[Chorus]
Give me one for the road she's on tonight
Her Firestones turning, Firebird burning right out of my life
'Fore the lights come on and I pay my tab
And climb inside that yellow cab
To take me home
Give me one for the road she's on

[Verse 2]
65 south, State Route 7
Broadway, Main Street, County Road 11
Wherever she is four-lane forgetting 'bout me

[Chorus]
Give me one for the road she's on tonight
Her Firestones turning, Firebird burning right out of my life
'Fore the lights come on and I pay my tab
And climb inside that yellow cab
To take me home
Give me one for the road she's on

[Bridge]
Yeah, I ain't drunk, but I ain't sober
I know I'm still gonna wake up hungover on her
So what's one more gonna hurt?

[Chorus]
Give me one for the road she's on tonight
Her Firestones turning, Firebird burning right out of my life
'Fore the lights come on and I pay my tab
And climb inside that yellow cab
To take me home
Give me one for the road she's on

Give me one for the road she's on tonight

Talk About Georgia,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
I spent a lot of time underneath the lights down in San Antone
Yeah, I make good memories just about everywhere I go
Myrtle Beach, South Carolina
Sometimes you gotta put it all behind ya
But there's one thing that just can't get off my mind

[Chorus]
When I talk about Georgia
It's the color in your eyes
Or the summertime shining on ya
I remember every mile
Yeah, you drove me wild, baby
And the way it felt like nothing else
It's true, girl, I think about you
When I talk about Georgia
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my buddies still talk about that Daytona trip
Many years fly by, damn, it's hard to remember it
Fast-lane through Oklahoma
Tequila nights in California
But there's just one goodbye that gets me every time

[Chorus]
When I talk about Georgia
It's the color in your eyes
Or the summertime shining on ya
I remember every mile
Yeah, you drove me wild, baby
And the way it felt like nothing else
It's true, girl, I think about you
When I talk about Georgia
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, you're right here
You come back
Oh, baby, just like that

[Chorus]
When I talk about Georgia
It's the color in your eyes
Or the summertime shining on ya
I remember every mile
Yeah, you drove me wild, baby
And the way it felt like nothing else
It's true, girl, I think about you
When I talk about Georgia
Yeah
Oh, when I talk about Georgia

The Same Way,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
It doesn't matter if you grew up above the Mason-Dixon
Or down in Dixie
If you come from the east side or the west side
Of the Mississippi

[Pre-Chorus]
Little farm towns to them high-rise cities
Raise 'em up if you're with me

[Chorus]
If you got the same song coming out of your speakers
Got the same strong mix down in your cup
If you got smoke blowing in the air
Howling at the moon, if you do, then that's what's up
If you got your pretty green-eyed dime
Or ride-or-die-er beside you pulling that all-nighter
Yeah, we might be from a different place
But we go down the same way
The same way, the same way

[Verse 2]
This one's for them good ol' boys and girls, y'all
Let's get another round
Say it loud, let 'em know all over the world now
Country done come from

[Pre-Chorus]
Little farm towns to them high-rise cities
Raise 'em up if you're with me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
If you got the same song coming out of your speakers
Got the same strong mix down in your cup

Howling at the moon, if you do, then that's what's up

Or ride-or-die-er beside you pulling that all-nighter
Yeah, we might be from a different place
But we go down the same way
The same way, the same way

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, we go down the same way

[Bridge]
We believe it in our hearts when we say we're country
We ain't scared to back it up
Yeah, I think it'd be safe to say that we all think
That nobody does it like us

[Chorus]
If you got the same song coming out of your speakers
Got the same strong mix down in your cup
If you got smoke blowing in the air
Howling at the moon, if you do, then that's what's up
If you got your pretty green-eyed dime
Or ride-or-die-er beside you pulling that all-nighter
Yeah, we might be from a different place
But we go down the same way
The same way, the same way

Yeah, we go down the same way
The same way, the same way
Yeah, we go down the same way
Yeah, we go down the same way

She Likes It,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
She don't like it, catching cabs downtown
The noisy crowd, the people when the bar shuts down
And she don't like it when it rains, don't like the color gray
But if I know anything

[Chorus]
I know she likes it ridin' all night long
Shotgun, next to me
A little whiskey when the week's all gone
Gets her wild and running free
With the windows down
In a nowhere town
Getting lost somewhere to a song
I know she likes it ridin' all night long, yeah

[Verse 2]
She don't like it when it's eyes on her
Walking in the party, no, that ain't her
And she don't like it when I cuss, don't like it when I smoke
She don't like it when she's all alone

[Chorus]
But I know she likes it ridin' all night long
Shotgun, next to me
A little whiskey when the week's all gone
Gets her wild and running free
With the windows down
In a nowhere town
Getting lost somewhere to a song
I know she likes it ridin' all night long, yeah

[Bridge]
She likes to lean on in, likes to kick on back
She likes it when we go fast

[Chorus]
And I know she likes it ridin' all night long (All night long)
Shotgun, next to me
A little whiskey when the week's all gone
Gets her wild and running free
With the windows down
In a nowhere town
Getting lost somewhere to a song
I know she likes it ridin' all night long, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I know she likes it ridin' all night long, yeah

Hey, hey, hey, I saw lightning
Ho-ho-ho, I saw lightning
He-he-he, I saw lightning
Ha-ha-ha

I saw wind and rain
Saw mountains fall
Saw temples burn
And prison walls
I saw floods a-comin'
Saw children run
Got no more shelter
No more sun

[Chorus: Beck]
Then it came to me in a flash of light
By the sycamore tree in the dead of night
The bottom bell in the longest day
In the hottest wind, I'm in the falling rain
I saw lightning, saw lightning, saw lightning
Held my head up and it struck me down
Down to the ground
It struck me down, struck me down
Struck me down to the ground

[Refrain: Beck]
There was a day, saw lightning
There was a day, saw lightning
Hey, hey, hey, I saw lightning
Ho-ho-ho, I saw lightning

[Verse 2: Pharrell Williams]
When it ain't up, wonder where it go
Hold the sea as somewhere to row
Over did then dead heroes
Make it easy and sunny and go
We hold the sea and know the unknown
Old Man Dan, 'cause some of them are low
Wondering 'bout where do we go
Until then, we boat

[Chorus: Beck]
Then it came to me in a flash of light
By the sycamore tree in the dead of night
The bottom bell in the longest day
In the hottest wind, I'm in the falling rain
I saw lightning, saw lightning, saw lightning
I held my head up (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And it struck me down (Ooh!)
Down to the ground (Ooh!)
And it struck me down, struck me down
Struck me down on the ground (Ooh!)

Die Waiting,Beck,"

I'm gonna wait on you, gonna wait on you

I don't care what I have to do
Know that I'm gonna wait on you

Got my body reeling
Really coming off the ceiling
All my memories got me kneeling
Almost got a real thing
Almost got a new leaf
Darker than you ever knew it
Something that you're going through it, oh, yeah

I don't care what I have to do
Know that I'm gonna wait on you
I don't care what I have to do
Know that I'm gonna wait on you

Just to walk out of the door, see the world moving on
And I lay down in the sun with the moonlight in my eyes
If it takes a lifetime, then you know I got time, oh, yeah

I don't care what I have to do
Know that I'm gonna wait on you
I don't care what I have to do

Chemical,Beck,"

You say that love is a chemical
Feel it down to the soul
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
What I really, really want to know
Is if my mind's in control
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa

[Chorus]
I'm so high
Love is a chemical
I'm so high
Love is a chemical
Start it, start it again

[Verse 2]
A random thought, a memory
A tidal wave, a melody, I'm on my knees
A sudden change in everything
Don't know when I was leaving feeling well and free
You find love just a fantasy
Beautiful and ugly as a life can be
And I don't lose any sleep honestly, whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa

[Chorus]
I'm so high
Love is a chemical
I'm so high
Love is a chemical
Start it, start it again

[Bridge]
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa
I can feel it minute by minute by day
I don't want it running all night this way
Why you got to get it on my mind this way?
Whoa-whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa

[Verse 3]
Saying what I feel
What can I tell you? Don't know
Why you have to be like that?
Alligator teardrops fall
Love is a, love is a chemical
Burning wears off like a chemical
I don't need anyone to turn me on
I don't need anyone, no

[Verse 4]
And when the feeling is over
There's no explanation
Shock to the system
Infatuation
Shake like a flower
Strange affirmation
Crown of a nation
Start it, start it again

[Outro]
(I'm) Saying what I feel
(So high) What can I tell you? Don't know
(Love) Why you have to be like that?

Come and see what I'm going through
Now I need you, you need me
I'm running that feeling
Summertime nights, I'm gonna run to meet you
Coming out of my mind, you know I'm dying to reach you, whoa
Something from nothing
Something from nothing
You want something from nothing
But I got nothing left to give

[Chorus]
See through
You and I can always see through
See through
You can see how much I need you (I think I'm gonna need you)
See through (All right now)
See how much I really need you (I think I'm gonna need you)
See through (All right now)
See how much I really need you

[Outro]
Oh
Hey, yeah
Mm-yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
I feel so ugly when you see through me
I feel so ugly when you see through me

Hyperspace,Beck,"

[Verse 1]
Faster, farther, longer, harder
I just wanna grow and grow
Beauty, light and crushing life
Wanna feel more and more

[Chorus]
In hyperspace, electric life is in my brain
In hyperspace, spend all my nights and all my days
With you
With you

[Verse 2]
My life is hyperspace, summer days out of phase from the praise
Gamma rays touching base just in case tidal waves
Fueling hate, time it takes, overlaid, mutilated
Take your pay, celebrated, let your mind disintegrate
(What's going on?) I’m concentrating (Where you at?) I'm navigating
I'm losing form, it’s all resonating, no recant, articulated
Infrastructure all outdated, this could all be a simulation
User needs to be intimidated, they won't know when they're invalidated

[Chorus]
In hyperspace, spend all my nights and all my days
With you
With you
With you
With you

"
Stratosphere,Beck,"

[Verse 1]
Turn me around
Collision course with the sun
Far above the ground
Halfway to oblivion

[Chorus]
In the stratosphere
There's nowhere to go from here
In the stratosphere
I'll be back home another year

[Verse 2]
High as the moon
Earth below to comfort me
Needle to the spoon
Strike a match and let it be

[Chorus]
In the stratosphere
There's nowhere to go from here
In the stratosphere
Somewhere I can disappear

In the stratosphere
There's nowhere to go from here
In the stratosphere
Be back home another year

"
Dark Places,Beck,"

[Verse 1]
Time moves on and on, love, it goes
Now she's gone and all I see are shadows
It's two in the morning, I'm so in the moment
It's two in the morning, I'm so in the moment
Some days I go dark places on my own
Some days I go dark places in my soul

[Bridge]
Come and see me
Do you need me?
Hiding deeply
In the feeling
Been so lonely
So unholy
Make me feel free
Come and let me down slow

[Verse 2]
There's a place in this world
For you and I, you and I, you and I
Hold your head up, golden girl
For you and I, you and I
Until the day we die

[Outro]
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on
It's you and I and you and I
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on
It's you and I, you and I
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on
Gone and on and on and on

Star,Beck,"

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
She said you better stay, stay right where you are
I might get knocked down by a fallin' star
Set you straight before you hurt yourself somewhere
Sinkin' like the stone, up into mid-air
And she's workin' out the meaning of the game
By the taciturn complexion of her face
Days and days I've faced myself amazed
I take myself down the Georgia Main

[Chorus]
She's got the coin of the realm
And the hounds of Hell
She's ringin' the bell
Holdin' on to herself
She's got the light in her eyes
And the blue from the sky (Oh)
She's crossin' my mind
Better hold on to myself
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-oh)
(Ooh-ooh)
(Oh, no-no-no, no)

[Verse 2]
Shimmy shimmy shake, the lights are on
Takin' the time to get me gone (Ayy)
She's walkin' crooked down the hall
Fallin' down the waterfall (Woo)
Shimmy shimmy shake, the lights are on
Takin' the time to get me gone
She's walkin' crooked down the hall
Fallin' down the waterfall

[Chorus]
She's got the coin of the realm
And the hounds of Hell
She's ringin' the bell
Holdin' on to herself
She's got the light in her eyes
And the blue from the sky
She's crossin' my mind
Better hold on to myself

[Outro]
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear
Dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear
My love, my love
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, she's so, oh, yeah, yeah

Everlasting Nothing,Beck,"

[Verse 1]
You threw the keys to the kingdom
Over a skyscraper wall
Sowing seeds somewhere obsolete
In the everlasting nothing
It's been a long night in the slipstream
I thought I'd crash and burn if I came down
When I did, I found a friend to take me home
In the everlasting nothing

[Chorus]
Friends I've known, come and gone
Like a soldier with no song
Still, I try to get back home
In the everlasting nothing

[Verse 2]
I woke up in a movie
Didn't know if it was my whole life
When it ended, I laughed before I cried
In the everlasting nothing
And I washed up on the shoreline
Everyone was waiting there for me
Like a standing ovation for the funeral of the sun
In the everlasting nothing

[Chorus]
Friends I've known, come and gone
Like a soldier with no song
Still, I try to get back home
In the everlasting nothing

[Outro]
Nowhere child, keep on running
Nowhere child, keep on running
In your time, you'll find something
In the everlasting nothing
Nowhere child, keep on running
Nowhere child, keep on running
In your time, you'll find something
In the everlasting nothing
Nowhere child, keep on running
Nowhere child, keep on running
In your time, you'll find something
In the everlasting nothing

Never coming back down

Die A Little Bit,Tinashe,"

Woah

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Sometimes I can’t, but I’ve been told I need to breathe
This life ain't something for someone like you and me
We just get caught up in the things that we don't need
Plenty time wasted, what are we waitin' for?
Searching for something in someone without a soul
Running in circles 'cause I suck at letting go
Starting to feel like there's no chance of breaking through
Plenty time wasted, what am I waitin' for?

Know Better,Tinashe,"

[Part I: Know Better]

[Intro]
Bongo turn it up
Bongo by the way

[Verse 1]
Sitting here with my thoughts in a bottle
Every time I take a sip, I'm reminded of you
Like, how you been?
Wait a minute, what am I doing?
It feels different when you're not around

[Pre-Chorus]
Never thought that this would be us
I feel a way, I feel a way, baby
I was fighting, but you gave up
Now you feel a way, you feel a way
And I

[Chorus]
Wanna love you, but I know better, better
Wanna kiss you, but I know better
I know better, baby
Miss you, but I know better
Got me telling all my secrets
Got me in and out my feelings tonight

[Verse 2]
Who was wrong? Who was right? Doesn't matter
""It'll fade over time"" is what I'll tell myself
Hit decline on my line when you call now
I'm distant, it's different with you, oh-ooh-ah

[Pre-Chorus]
All those nights I cried over us (Cried over us)
Where were you then? (Where were you then?)
Where were you then, baby? (Oh woah)
I don't wanna feel that again (Feel that again)
I'm still afraid, I'm still afraid
And I

[Chorus]
Wanna love you, but I know better, better
Wanna kiss you, but I know better
I know better, baby
Miss you, but I know better
Got me telling all my secrets
Got me in and out my feelings tonight
Wanna love you, but I know better, better (Know, yeah)
Wanna kiss you, but I know better

(Telling all my secrets)
(In and out my feelings tonight)

[Part II: Did You Notice?]

[Verse]
Somewhere over the horizon
Sun is rising on you with no me
I would put my pride aside
If you could promise to be worth the wait
Hoping that you think about us
Sometimes, I'm still leaning on the lonely
Another broken heart, another day
When I fall in love, I guess I'm always gonna stay
Living like a ghost, I'm haunted
All I want is to feel like the old me
Fade away a little slower
I go over every word you told me
If it was all lies, then why did I feel
I'm in heaven when you hold me
Another broken heart, another day
When I fall in love, I guess I always find a way

[Pre-Chorus]
Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name
Hoping just a little that you feel the same, anyway
Honestly, what's another break up to a girl like me?
I could find another lover easily and you know it
Tell me

[Chorus]
Did you notice I've been doing just fine?
It's like you're never here and the tears have all dried
Did you notice, did you notice me?
Did you notice I've been doing okay?
Don't even think about you every single day
Did you notice me? Oh

[Bridge]
Ooh, ah
Ooh, oh
Ooh, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Still feels like I could fall to pieces when I hear your name
Hoping just a little that you feel the same, anyway, oh
Honestly, what's another break up to a girl like me?
I could find another lover easily and you know it
Tell me

[Chorus]
Did you notice I've been doing just fine?
It's like you're never here and the tears have all dried
Did you notice, did you notice me?
Did you notice I've been doing okay?
Still think about you every single night and day
Did you notice me?

"
You,Tinashe,"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder if I make myself too unavailable
Been with less people than you could count legs on an end table
What can I say? I'm loyal
Sometimes it hurts to be loyal
Sometimes I think I'm missing out on things I'm supposed to go through
Guess that sacrifice is when you trying to take over at 22
I'm so focused, I'm focused, I'm so focused, I'm focused
Maybe that's a mistake, maybe it's a blessing
'Cause people out here are snakes and my time is wasting

[Verse 2]
I'm not stopping, I'm not falling, got no time slow up
Selling shows out on my own
Yeah, I'm about to blow up
So many plans, so much to do
But in that bed, rockin' ""svu svu""
Got so much time to settle down
But it'd be nice to mess around

[Chorus]
Ooh
Just the way I like you

Ooh
Just the way I like you

[Instrumental]

[Interlude 1]
You know, you know, you know
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
But it feels nice, sometimes sweet
When you kissin' on my spine
Fuckin' me deep, deep, deep
We can be angels
When you're pushin' off me
Weavin' me [?]
Inside our sheets

[Interlude 2]
You know, you know, you know, yeah
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just the way I like you

Tinashe (Yeah?)
It's been a long time coming
Could tell you needed dick, you spent a long time cumming (Mm)
We went four rounds, spent a long time fucking (Uh huh)
I rather stay inside with you than all night clubbing, yeah (Okay)
I seent you from a distance, said I got a plan
And I don't give a fuck if you got a man
Makin' up for missed time, covered a lot of land
I'm in a 'Rari, I'ma get you off with my hand, yeah (Yeah, uh)
I'ma take it slow, nothing to rush into
The whole world knew I always had a crush on you
When I leave the studio, I swear I'm fucking you
I mean for real, Tinashe, let's leave here right now, hey

[Chorus: Tinashe]
So much better, I'll love you better, yeah
Kiss you better, I'll touch you better, yeah (Treat you better, better, ah)
Treat you better (Fuck you better), I'll fuck you better (So much better)
So much better (Make you better), I'll make you better, yeah

[Outro: Tinashe]
When you finally fall in love
Find the one
Would you let it go if I trade you gold?
Would you fight for what you want, baby?
Would you fight for what you want?
Your soul, soul, soul, ah
Would you fight for what you want?
When you fall in, fall in love, baby
Would you let it go?
Would you sell your soul?

Fall in so easy
Why am I so reckless with my heart?
Why? Oh no
Oh, but I just wanna love ya, I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love you, love you in spite of it, everything
I just wanna kiss ya, I just wanna hold ya
I just wanna touch you, need you inside of me

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we went to the park at night?
I told you how I felt, I'll never forget
I hope you know I meant, I hope you know I meant
Every word I said, every word I said to you, babe
I was made for you
Ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
Pickin' up the pieces of a mess
But I feel like myself again, ooh, oh
Think I saw forever in your eyes
Eyes
Know the situation's pretty complicated
I just wanna go back, if we could foster it, no
Hope you're not just playin' with my emotions
Or maybe I'm just stupid to still believe in it

[Chorus]
Do you remember when, made you those promises?
I'll never forget, I'll never forget
I hope you know I meant, I hope you know I meant
Every word I said, every word I said to you, babe

Leray,Trippie Redd,"

[Intro]
Good to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
""I thought you was married to the single life"", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit

[Verse]
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart, yeah

I was always looking for a caretaker
Looking for someone that would protect me, take initiative for me
And just be the greatest person they could for me
And that may be selfish, I don't know
But, it's, that's just me being honest
And every time I've kinda let myself be led on by someone, they either deceive me or
Just treat me really, really, really bad, and I'm
I'm a very genuine person and I'm far too emotional and I care too much
And I've, I've definitely cared too much in situations and been fucked over

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Yeah, big blunts, I like to roast up
Pussy get no love and no luck, I don't fuckin' know ya
Chillin' with the gang, I like to post up
Get up off the block if I don't know you
You dealin' with some soldiers that ride with the motherfuckin' pole, bruh
I ride with the motherfuckin' pole, bruh
I rise with the motherfuckin' pole, bruh
And you know a motherfucker pop a sealy, pop a pilly
Pop a nigga head like Amoxicillin
I'm a villain, really don't show no pity
I'm high saditty to these bitches
Bitch, she hot and juicy, I'm hot and gritty
How you hot and shitty? Wait
'Cause shit hot, but you know your shit not
My shit make the whole city rock
And Diddy bop, I spit it off the titty-top
And if you don't like it, then fuck nigga, eat a itty-bitty cock (Yeah)
Eeny-meeny-miney-moe, catch a thottie by her toe
If I let her go, then I'll prolly fuck another ho (Snotty Nose Mafia, bitch)

[Verse 2: Chris King]
I stack the paper like a binder, she slimy, she not a rider
A nigga got bars, who's your service provider?
Still searching for a lighter, too many that sound just like us
We get rewarded for the likeness, get too many plaques like gingivitis
Got the touch like King Midas, I eat the beat, I get the 'itis
Create-a-player, I ball, it's like I turned up all the sliders
Okay, pop a sealy like amoxicillin
When I pop the trigger, drop a nigga
Then he shook his body like a macarena
Mop a stranger, he was starin' straight, catchin' improper angles
God can't save you, slap my bitch from the back, call it Palm's Angels
I bet when a nigga hop up, bitches, they'll be all angry
I told Trippie three years ago that this game was ours, nigga
Bathing Ape face mask like these rappers got SARS, nigga
I be in the background, you can see that I'm a star, nigga
I got where I am being exactly who I are, nigga
You ain't protected at the garage, out your car, nigga
I'm the bomb just like a warhead, go to war just like a jar-head
Give this dog a bone and think I wasn't gon' catch it like that shit was farfetched
Young nigga, stayin' on point just like a bayonet
We rollin' top down, bummin' on the main street, then I sprayed the 'Vette
Just a young nigga but I been doin' it for so long they gotta praise the vet
For my niggas on lockdown, and the crimies that really plead the fifth
Pourin' lean inside the booth, yeah, I am multitasking, make multi-millions
M-16 and blow up your blow-up mattress, you know what's brackin'

Then There Were Two,Mark Ronson,"

And then there were two
Right now we have to start somewhere
How far to go? I don't care
Just when I thought you'd leave me blue
You come around outta nowhere

Yeah, just when I thought you'd leave me there
You came back cool (You came back cool)
My company is leaving the minute that you tell me we gotta move
'Cause without you, I'ma sloucher, but witcha, I'm ambitious
Such a monster when I'm not near you
But together we can't stop looking in mirrors

Right now we have to start somewhere (Start somewhere)
How far to go? I don't care (Baby, I don't care)
Just when I thought you'd leave me blue (So blue!)
You come around outta nowhere (Outta nowhere)

Hundred million people just to smother the mood
I had to plead to get them all out the room
But then there were two
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Just when I thought I'd seen it all, I stand confused
My understanding is weak and I been seriously thinking it might be true
'Cause without you, I'ma sloucher, but witcha, I'm ambitious
Such a monster when I'm not near you
But together we can't stop looking in mirrors

Yeah, right now we have to start somewhere (We have to start somewhere)
How far to go? I don't care (Baby, I don't care, don't care)
Just when I thought you'd leave me blue (So blue!)
You come around outta no where (Outta nowhere)

Hundred million people just to smother the mood
I had to plead to get them all out the room
But then there were two
Ooh, yeah, yeah

Big boss, tailor-made garments
The only I needed was reason to be cautious
If I call it like I see it, then I would say I'm starting to become a decent human being without losing my monster
I started at the beginning, all that matters is the common ground that we live in and getting this bread like park pigeon
How far to go? I never paid attention
When I'm with you, I can complete any big or small mission

Right now we have to start somewhere
How far to go? I don't care
Just when I thought you'd leave me blue
You come around outta nowhere

Hundred million people just to smother the mood
I had to plead to get them all out the room
But then there were two

Scared of what we're made of

It's not the time that changed us
It's the dreams that we weren't chasing
Come back to haunt us, eventually

That's why every morning, after dawn and
Tell your darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

That's why every morning, after dawn and
Tell your darling something is calling
Drive me crazy, I just can't explain it

Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind, out of your mind)
Go out of your mind (Out of your mind, out of your mind)
No, we can't rewind, life ain't no time machine
But once you free your mind, there's beauty in everything

Fall On Me,A Great Big World,"

[Verse 1: A Great Big World]
Sooner or later the lights up above
Will come down in circles and guide me to love
I don't know what's right for me
I cannot see straight
I've been here too long and I don't wanna wait for it

[Verse 2: A Great Big World]
Fly like a cannonball straight to my soul
Tear me to pieces and make me feel whole
I'm willing to fight for it
To feel something new
To know what it's like to be sharing a space with you

[Chorus: A Great Big World]
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

Sooner or later, it all comes apart
The walls are all shattered, I'm back at the start
And I'm willing to follow this
Wherever it goes
The heart has its reasons that nobody knows

[Verse 4: Christina Aguilera]
And I wanna believe in a world we can't see
Millions of particles passing through me
And I know there's a meaning
I feel it, I swear
I can't see the future, but I know that it's there

[Chorus: Christina Aguilera with A Great Big World]
Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me

I close my eyes
And I'm seeing you everywhere
I step outside
It's like I'm breathing you in the air
I can feel you're there

Fall on me
With open arms
Fall on me
From where you are
Fall on me
With all your light
With all your light
With all your light

With all your light

Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"

[Verse 1]
I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone, all I hear are the words that I needed to say

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Verse 2]
Was never the right time, whenever you called
Went little by little by little until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face

[Pre-Chorus]
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't

[Chorus]
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

[Bridge]
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know

[Chorus]
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go

Bruises,Lewis Capaldi,"

[Verse 1]
Counting days, counting days
Since my love up and got lost on me
And every breath that I've been taking
Since you left feels like a waste on me
I've been holding on to hope
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
'Cause every word that I've heard spoken
Since you left feels like a hollow street

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

[Verse 2]
Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
By the brighter side
Of what we had because it's over
Well, there must be something in the tide

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Your love I'm lost in
Even though I'm nothing to you now
Even though I'm nothing to you now

[Chorus]
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under
There must be something in the water
'Cause every day, it's getting colder
And if only I could hold you
You'd keep my head from going under

Imagination,Labrinth,"

[Chorus]
Imagination
Imagination
Only in my imagination
Imagination
Imagination
Only in my imagination

[Verse]
As the sun lopsided and the birds fly sideways
And I shake the sky with a heavenly smile on my face
And I draw up Picassos and I spray paint Banksys
And we live on L-O-V-E like it was our salaries
And we plant these seeds that we call ideas
And they grow like trees, bearing fruits on twigs
And we just don't leave 'cause we like it here
Making Shangri-La inside of our heads

[Chorus]
Imagination
Imagination
I live in this imagination
Now

Everybody, get out your nasty moves
So let's talk some shit and pour some booze, fuck it
What's a girl to do? Is this what you want? Fuck you

""You're the party girl, you're the tragedy""
But the funny thing's I'm fucking everything

Hey, I don't do that dance

Hey, I don't do that dance
Don't circumcise my circumstance
Hey, I don't do that dance
I only do my own dance

[Bridge]
I don't owe 'em nothing, maybe I owe everything
Grateful for the lovers and even the haters
I feel like I'm nothing; somedays, I am everything
Caught up in my feelings; bitch, shut up and sing
Ooh

Hey, I don't do that dance
Hey, I don't do that (No)
Hey, I don't do that dance
I only do my own dance
Hey, I don't do that dance
Don't circumcise my circumstance
Hey, I don't do that dance

Hey, I don't do that dance (I don't do that dance)
Hey, I don't do that (Do that, do that)
Hey, I don't do that dance (I don't do that dance)
I only do my own dance
Hey, I don't do that dance (I don't do that dance)
Don't circumcise my circumstance
Hey, I don't do that dance (I don't do that dance)
I only do my own dance

Sugar Coat,Little Big Town,"

[Verse 1]
I turn the bathroom light on
To take my make up off
Look at myself in the eye
I wonder why I wear it anyway
Another car drives by
I wonder where you are
The kids are all in bed
And everything but you is in its place
From the street view lookin' in
It's pretty as a picture
Our home sweet home

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I liked drinkin'
Sometimes I wish I liked pills
Wish I could sleep with a stranger
But someone like me never will
Sometimes I hardly can stand it
I just smile with a lump in my throat
Sometimes I wish I could bear it
And didn't have to wear this sugar coat

[Verse 2]
Passed down from my mom
She worried so well
She rested on my shoulders
Says it's cold out there, anything
Would I recognize myself
With anybody else?
If I took the damn thing off
And burned it

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I liked drinkin'
Sometimes I wish I liked pills
Wish I could sleep with a stranger
But someone like me never will
Sometimes I hardly can stand it
I just smile with a lump in my throat
Sometimes I wish I could bear it
And didn't have to wear this sugar coat

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, this damn sugar coat

[Bridge]
In one of these nights I'll meet you in the driveway
And tell you to go to hell
Go to hell

[Chorus]
Sometimes I wish I liked drinkin'
Sometimes I wish I liked pills
Wish I could sleep with a stranger
But someone like me never will
Sometimes I hardly can't stand it
I just smile with a lump in my throat
Sometimes I wish I could bear it
And didn't have to wear this sugar coat

[Post-Chorus]
This damn sugar coat
Oh, this sugar coat
This damn sugar coat

I Don't Wanna Get Wise,The Who,"

He was drunk, I was blind
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk, always late
We were quick to rotate

Let's be blunt, I was a bluff
And the surreal life was tough
I was a runt, we told lies
But to our great surprise

All the shit that we did
Brought us some money, I guess
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success

Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell

We don't wanna get wise
(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
Life teaches us well

We still pull, we get smug
And we all like a drug
Over full, always sated
Puffed up, elated

Let's admit our mistakes
Are what triggered our breaks
We were shits, oh, no disguise
And it is no surprise

That the crap that we did
Brought us money, God bless
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success

Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell

We didn't wanna get wise
(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
Life teaches us well

Experiment, you universe
We'll ask why you choose to curse
Why set a fire you plan to douse?
Why set a rat to catch a mouse?

He was drunk (he was drunk), I was blind (he was blind)
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk (he was sunk), he was late (always late)
We were quick to rotate

We tried hard to stay young
But the high notes were sung
We've been scarred, we've been prized
But you could see in our eyes

(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
We got wise!

(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
We got wise
(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
We got wise
(I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise)
We got wise

Dropped outta college, but bitch, I'm still ballin'

Can't make a clone 'cause I'm one-of-one
Lil' boy, you ain't even one of them

Two twins, tell 'em double dutch
Two twins, had to double cup
And they both dance, told them, ""Fuck it up""

Foreign cars on a foreign line
Foreign bras and they all fine

VALENTINO,24kGoldn,"

I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino
Deep throat
Know I get it in like a free throw
Shawty want some mo'
She just can’t seem to keep her knees closed
I don’t want a valentine

Ain’t no Minute Maid
My diamonds lemonade
Flexin' hard, call me Popeye
Wallet filled with spinach, ayy
Cut you off on the interstate
I’m first to finish, ayy

Bitch it’s always been that way
To the grave, might just be tomorrow
Might just be today
So I always live it up
We poppin' bottles
Poppin' K's
Gucci shades from my bougie bitch
I ain’t even had to pay
Had to put on for the team
And had to put on for the Bay
I'm still fly when I wear robins wings
I can’t stay in one place
Russian Creams in my rocket ship
We go to outer space
Mask off, mask on, fuck it
I can’t catch a case
Blast off, blast off
See the stars up in Wraith
You can't get into the crib
Because the mansion got a gate
You can't come into my section
I’m gon' put you in your place
If your club goin' up
You bet I’m sliding like it's chess
And I think I fell in love
She shook that ass up in my face

I don’t want a valentine
I just want Valentino
I just want the neck
I poker face like a casino

Know I get it in like a free throw

Can I learn to love these chains?
I know I had a point but now I forgot it
While I'm circlin' the drain

Degenerates,A Day To Remember,"

[Chorus]
My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

[Verse 1]
Why do we tend to hurt one another?
Dividin' up all the books by the covers
Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me
(Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me)
Or could I sum you up just by what I see?

[Pre-Chorus]
In reality, everyone's a lot more complicated

[Chorus]
My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

[Post-Chorus]
Or so they say

[Verse 2]
I get that look more than I remember
Turnin' your nose up while we're at dinner
Like how can he afford somethin' that I want?
(Like how can he afford somethin' that I want?)
Sold all your empathy, tell me what it cost
(Sold all your empathy, tell me what it cost)

Character is who you are when no one's watchin'

But I'd never change them

Like a moment of truth that you try to omit
Consequences retained for the judgement ya give
When you finally find you're the degenerate
It's gonna hit like a brick!

Like it ain't hard enough simply bein' me
Or could I sum you up just by what I see?

My friends are degenerates
But I'd never change them
Liars, cheats, and hypocrites
Not the type for savin'

Hey, won't you call me back?
'Cause I've been waiting for a text back

Pretty sure we could never date

You're just stuck in space
Just playing your bass

A bastard son, a rebel, now look at me

I'm fucked up from prescriptions and antidepressants

Why are we so casual 'bout these casualties?

Come like a cool summer rain

Living Proof,Des Rocs,"

Through all this pain
And all of the loss
I paid the heavy price
When they vowed to shut me off

Wrapped up in chains
And alone in the dark
Told lies so many times
Cause they’re afraid of what we are

This house was a fairy tale
Hiding songs of a kiss and tell
Some martyr tried to wish me well
But that fire’s gotta feed

I’m living proof that the worst can be beat
If ya pull yourself together you can get on your feet

Living proof that the strength you will need
Has been in you forever but to get it, you’ll bleed

Don’t need faith
The devil knocks but he don’t call no more
Oh we go down together baby
See Mary right up there on that cross

When the sun fades
The pink is gonna run
But the day comes again
So save your tears for you hunny

Ever since I was a young nigga, I spazzed out
Even when I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Ayy (Yeah), ayy (Go dummy Kyle)

[Chorus]
Ever since I was a young nigga, I spazzed out
Even when I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out
Only in it for the commas, I don't need no handouts
Ever since I was a young nigga, I spazzed out
Even since I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out
Only in it for the commas, I don't need no handouts, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Take some time to deal with all this pain
You get caught up in the streets, it's like you caught up in this game
Know some niggas that'll die, you drain 'em of this life for fame
My lil' partner goin' crazy, he got drugs up in his brain
Man, this life is just so different, how our problems be the same
I just find it hard to smile, them niggas really know my name
Prophecies I'm really livin' make a nigga go insane
Got these trials and tribulations, I be facin' all this pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I got visions of this money, that shit's caught up in my brain
Visions that they really love me, keep the choppa, can't complain
When they plan out your demise, that's when you give 'em what has changed
Rest in peace to all them niggas, I can't switch up what I'm sayin' (Uh, ayy)

Young nigga, I spazzed out
Even when I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out

Even since I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out
Only in it for the commas, I don't need no handouts (Ayy)

Effort through the struggles, I was blessed to persevere
From the start and to the finish, I won't tell my time is near
Always told to keep it solid with my brothers, them that's here
I got mama and my brothers, father's really close to here
I won't take my steps to life and walk a balance that is near
I was brought up in this life to raise that muscle from the fear
I rock foreign stitchin' on me when I'm hoppin out the leer
I got diamonds in my teeth so when I speak, you see me clear

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't tell me 'bout this pain from all this rap and all this doubt
All these niggas steady watchin', man, these niggas out for clout
Couple thousand in my pocket, my whole team will air it out
This was nothin' but a dream, my niggas livin' better now (Ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
Young nigga, I spazzed out
Even when I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out
Only in it for the commas, I don't need no handouts
Ever since I was a young nigga, I spazzed out
Even since I was a youngin', always went through mad doubt
Always went and tell my mama how I move, I stand out
Only in it for the commas, I don't need no handouts, ayy

Niggas' bitches, they really be switchin' up
Can't play no game, I got too much to lose
Want me to fall, I got somethin' to prove
Really steal with no trace, I won't leave 'em a clue
And the truck lookin' reggae, I painted it blue
If it's me and my shawty, we hop in the coupe
My lil' youngins go crazy, they lovin' the crew
He handle business, can't wait to recruit him
Pop me a Addy, tryna make me a movie
I can't stand still when my diamonds keep movin' (Movin')
Gave all my heart, tryna guide 'em to do it
Got partners who gon' tryna guide 'em with music
Lil' bro don't play 'round, if he got it, he use it (Use it)
Go against us, nigga gotta be stupid
Ride 'round with the stick, how I gotta be movin' (Man)

Rollie don't tick but it got big rocks
Bands in the whip, do the dash from the cops
Chain lookin' bliss, with the pole on my hip (Ayy)
Let me go, I'm equipped, but don't bang with the opps (Ooh)
Pain to regret but it's more that I get
Really made for this shit, money made, it don't stop
Say Heaven sent, I was made for the flip
I was made for this shit and I bang for the block (What?)
Beam and a Jag', got the Benz' on the lot
Went and copped me a crib just to park up the drop (Benz, Benz, gang, gang)
Fuck do you mean? I was lost in the drought (Ayy)
Got the bag comin' into the stars and I'm out (What?)
Money comin' in so you know a nigga goin' (Damn)

Get my guap up and down
I get chips like Frito Lay
Fuck on that bitch, she in love, I just bust
Hop out the Wraith just to start up my day
Diamonds, they hit, smokin' kill from the skunk
Copped me a chain so you know I get paid
Pockets on paid, I'm equipped with a snub
Fuck I need love for? I copped me a safe
Fuck I need love for? I copped me a— Uh

She takin' trips when it's cold in the winter
Daddy gon' smile while I hop out the rental
I pray for my sins, asking God to forgive 'em
I chase the chips all I want, Frito Lay
I pull the flip while it's out of the rental
All for the guala, it's only the guala
I swear shit is stuck up all up in my mental
All that I want, man, I swear is the commas
Watch for the problems 'cause niggas is snakes
I switch up on 'em like bad revolvers
Run for the commas so niggas get paid
Visions is true, man, I swear I'm just honest
How can I lose, man? I swear, niggas fake
Visions is true, man, I swear I'm a problem myself
With the guala I stack, Frito Lay
I don't get fucked by no problem
I'm focused on commas, you see I'm just tryna get paid
I was just all on the block, I was posted
Was stuck, I was prayin' I'd live better days
Niggas is hatin' up on me, them diamonds is on me
It's glitter, I shine like the ray
Niggas is hatin' up on me, them diamonds is on me
Got hundred stacks stacked in the safe, bitch

Lil' mama love when her chips hit the bank
And then I went and I flooded the face
They was frontin' on me, I had no money
Yeah, but that was just back in the day
I swear, I'm runnin' laps around these niggas
And they just been runnin' around in a maze
I'm hoppin' out of the Bentley
With all of my diamonds on me now she lookin' amazed
Ain't got a bag, tell her get out the way
My bitch a boss and she whippin' a Range
Give her the dick and she just want a taste
Ride with the clip, you get hit with the pain
They throwin' shots but they ain't got no aim
Ain't had a ho since a nigga had AIM
Ayy, bro, we sendin' out packs like it's AOL
He got locked with the shit but he made the bail
You got locked with the shit and you made a tell
Keep the fake, free the real ones about to sell
And she on me 'cause my name is ringin' bells
Shawty a freak and she great with the face
I get the chips, gettin' my Frito Lay
Ain't doin' shit 'til the bag on the way

Get my guap up and down

Told her I can't change cause I'm just caught up in the game
Thinking of my family and all the shit we need
Thinking if I lose 'em I'll be caught up in the pain
I ain't tryna show 'em that this life I live a game
Lost in dimensions but caught up in mentions
I pour all intentions, they're pure when they're mentioned
All for ascension and gold and that next shit
I call, you pick up, then you all on that next shit
Thoughts that you messed with, you caused just to get shit
I call, you pick up, but you all on that next shit
Thoughts that you mess with, you caused just to get shit

Ayy, young nigga on the block, I was trappin'
Different type of nigga, I was never with the actin'
Glizzy on my hip, and I ain't tryna make it happen
Niggas always talkin', but I'm focused on the action
When they come the money, shit, it turn you to a savage
When they come the money, nigga say you switched from average
Focused what I'm livin', I can't switch up what the bag did
Focused what I'm livin', rockin' foreign shit, Italian
What you know 'bout struggle? Flippin' words and make it happen
Stuck up on the block, I had my brothers with me trappin'
Niggas tried to hate and said I couldn't make it happen
Now I'm gettin' money, fill the duffel with the racks, and
Now I'm gettin' money, fill the duffel, let the racks build

Tryna stack this money, man, I had to make it happen
Flippin' all this work, I had to re-up, make the bag flip
Smokin' all this dope, to make me ease up off that action
When it come to money, shit it turn them to a savage
When it come to money, separated from the average
Tryna live it lovely, but I'm caught up in this trappin'
Bimmer, push to start, my diamonds hittin' while I'm passin'
Smokin' all this dope, it got me thinkin', ""How I land here?""
I ain't never love, 'cause honestly, I never played fair
All up through the struggles, honestly, I had to stay clear
Why you hatin' on me in my hood? I cannot stay there
Tryna live a lovely life, I live it, have sustain there
Thousands all up on me, plottin' millions, seen the safe there
Money all I want, and for that green you see I raced there
Life I live is lovely, for this green you see I'm chasin', yeah

We on the VIP side, we got a hundred bottles

I keep the Glizzy in the club, and I ain't ever shot though
I let it off in H-Town, sprayin' fully auto
I swear that I ain't ever tell, but I prolly lie, though
They gon' send me right to jail if they knew what I knew
God'll send me right to Hell if he knew what I know
These candles on me, they burnin'
Cameras on me keep turnin'
Been through the worst, ain't gon' lie, this shit be hurtin'
I'm tryna turn my life right 'round
This fame be gettin' to my brain, I'm puttin' this mic right down
This shit flaw, this shit creep
In these city streets, ten toes deep, they try to sneak me
I'm just tryna eat, and keep it G, they don't wanna see me

[Verse 2]
Feel like stepping outside
No more bad vibrations, wave them goodbye
There's a world I need to find
Leading smoke and mirrors, it's in your life

[Pre-Chorus]
There's an opportunity to make mine
I can do this, I can see through this
It's becoming clearer to me with open eyes

[Chorus]
No more waiting for a
No more waiting for a hope
No more waiting for a hope
Must be worth another try
No more waiting for a hope
No more waiting for a hope
Must be worth another try
No more waiting

[Bridge]
I can't experience the power of moments
Only complete if I feel it in real life
It's only complete if I feel it in real life

[Chorus]
No more waiting for a hope (No more waiting)
Must be worth another try (Another try)
No more waiting for a hope
Must be worth another try
No more waiting for a hope (Feel it in real life)
No more waiting for a hope
Must be worth another try
No more waiting for a

Tijuana,Friendly Fires,"

[Verse 1]
Stuck in Chula Vista, case is on another flight
A contractual invitation to get across the borderline
Now I'm drinking in the corner, reeling from the flashing lights
They're all dancing on the tables, maybe I should get on mine

[Chorus]
I've got two nights in Tijuana
Maybe I should let go
I've got two nights in Tijuana
I know that I should let go
Should let go

[Post-Chorus]
And when you asked to dance with me
I found my heart between two seas

[Verse 2]
Your fiery reputation had me feeling uptight
But the scene in Marko Disko, I can't help but crack a smile
Doing salud with the strangers, busy losing track of time
Need to stop the sun from rising 'cause these are all friends of mine

[Chorus]
I've got two nights in Tijuana
Maybe I should let go
I've got two nights in Tijuana
I know that I should let go
Should let go

[Post-Chorus]
And when you asked to dance with me
I found my heart between two seas
Two nights and I don't wanna leave
I found my heart between two seas

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I've got two nights in Tijuana
Maybe I should let go
I've got two nights in Tijuana
I know that I should let go

Dive Into Your Eyes,Friendly Fires,"

[Verse 1]
It's like the trees are breathing
Flowers blooming
It's too beautiful to be saying goodbye
On a day like this
Crystal waters
On untouched beaches
It's too beautiful to be saying goodbye
On a day like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me up
Waiting for the break up
As you call me up
Waiting for the break up
When you turn around
And look at me in that way
Time is running out
When you look at me in that way

[Chorus]
I dive into your eyes
One last time
I don't know why
It feels like I'm drowning
I dive into your eyes
One last time
I don't know why
It feels like I'm drowning
I dive into your eyes

[Verse 2]
Endless sunsets
On boundless oceans
It's too beautiful
To be saying goodbye
On a day like this

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me up
Waiting for the break up
As you call me up
Waiting for the break up
When you turn around
And look at me in that way
Time is running out
When you look at me in that way

I dive into your eyes
One last time
I don't know why
It feels like I'm drowning
I dive into your eyes
One last time
I don't know why
It feels like I'm drowning

Warning,Delaney Jane,"

(First message)

You know what it's like to be in a room full of people
But still feel completely alone
I feel that all the time
I feel that all the time

I've never been the type to talk first
In fact it kinda freaks me out to converse
I'll never know why, but it always hurts
To be an extroverted introvert

But as far back as I remember
I could find the words for every tear for every temper
It's poetry that found me when I was in a dark hole
Yeah it's poetry that came into my life and saved my soul

So what the fuck is this social anxiety
I can say goodbye with alcohol and that's the irony
Cause' I don't want to drink, I don't want to like drinking
But sometimes it's the only way to shut up all the thinking
So I drink
And maybe I take a bump
And one leads to the next and suddenly I'm fucking drunk
And then I blackout
When I wake up in the morning I hate who I've become
But it's too late to send a warning
It's too late to send a warning
Yeah it's too late to send a warning

"
Psycho,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a cycle
Psycho and I might go crazy, crazy
Never been so shy
So why am I socially uptight lately?
Lately
I know I'm not the only one who always feels alone
Tell me I'm not the only one who never feels at home

[Pre-Chorus]
I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down, oh, I, oh, I
I'm shrinking in this crowd right now
So alone somehow tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I could use a
I could use a
Yeah, I could use a
I could use a
Yeah, I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down tonight, tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm nervous and I can't breathe
Anxious and I can't sleep
I don't know myself
Messing up a good thing
Mood swings so low
And I'm sinking down again,'gain, 'gain

[Pre-Chorus]
I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down, oh, I, oh, I
I'm shrinking in this crowd right now
So alone somehow tonight, tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I could use a
I could use a
Yeah, I could use a
I could use a
Yeah, I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down tonight, tonight

[Bridge]
When I was a child I was so wild
How did I get here? How did I get here?
When I was a child I was so wild
How did I get here? Oh, how did I get here?
When I was a child I was so wild
How did I get here? How did I get here?
When I was a child I was so wild

[Chorus]
Oh, I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down, oh, I, oh, I
I'm shrinking in this crowd right now
So alone somehow tonight, tonight
Someone get me out my head before I make myself a mess
I could use a, I could use a
Yeah, I could use a friend right now
Come and hold me down, tonight, tonight

Hello My Loneliness,Delaney Jane,"

[Intro: Delaney Jane]
Hello my loneliness, so we meet again
You haven't changed a bit
I'm getting used to it
Remember when I told you I never wanted to speak again?
Hello my loneliness
This time can we be friends?

[Verse 1: Delaney Jane]
Wake up, out of commission
Truth is, I really miss him
Truth is, I know I did this
No, I never listen
To all my inhibitions
Instead, I'm burning bridges
Promise, this time is different
This time is different

[Pre-Chorus: Delaney Jane]
Seeing little pieces of myself, I'm in the dark
Shoulda listened to the voice inside my heart

[Chorus: Delaney Jane]
Hello my loneliness, so we meet again
You haven't changed a bit
I'm getting used to it
Remember when I told you
I never wanted to speak again?
Hello my loneliness
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?

[Verse 2: Call Me Karizma]
Feel me at two in the morning
Eyes burnin' from all the tears you've cried
I feel a friendship is forming
You need someone who stays by your side
And I see the way you look
When you look in the mirror
Struck with fear, stuck for years
But I'm down for life, so it's up from here
I'll never leave and if you ever need a level head to help you think
Or maybe just to let you be, I'll be that for you
I've seen bad so babe, I'll never be bad to you
So just relax, I'll glue back the pieces for you like

[Pre-Chorus: Delaney Jane]
Seeing little pieces of myself, I'm in the dark
Shoulda listened to the voice inside my heart

So we meet again
You haven't changed a bit
I'm getting used to it
Remember when I told you
I never wanted to speak again?
Hello my loneliness
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?

[Bridge: Delaney Jane & Call Me Karizma]
You only see me at my worst
(You know I got you when it hurts)
You only come out when I'm lonely
(Well maybe this time get to know me)

Hello my loneliness, so we meet again
You haven't changed a bit
I'm getting used to it
Remember when I told you
I never wanted to speak again?
Hello my loneliness
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?
This time can we be friends?

Bad Habits,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
Close the door
Take it off of me
Take it off for me
Clothes on the floor
This misery
Loves company

[Pre-Chorus]
Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

[Chorus]
A rush of blood to my head
My heart beats out of my chest
Bad habits
Bad habits
I said never again
But here you are in my bed
Bad habits
Bad habits

[Post-Chorus]
With you, you
Bad habits
Bad habits
With you, you
Bad habits, ooh

We keep secrets
Tell white lies
While we chase the highs
In each other's eyes
We can't stop this though we tried
We'll have superpowers in the afterhours 'til the day we die

Compulsive indulgence
We're making love out of focus
You'll always be my white rabbit
My favorite bad habit

A rush of blood to my head

Dirty pretty things and all

Dirty pretty things and all

Safe With You,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry
That's someone else's name you called me
Now that I turn around, you look familiar to me too
All of my friends left me
So typical, it gets so messy
And so I'm kinda happy that I found that in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You, I feel safe with you (you, you)
I feel safe with you (you, you)
I feel safe with you (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Thought I would regret coming to this party
Empty bottles left, I don't know nobody but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you
People poppin' pills, powder on the counter
Ain't my type of thrill, all these ups and downs but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you

[Verse 2]
Feels like
Feels like I knew you in a past life
The way we vibin', you and I just seem so natural
And every time I felt like this before (Yeah)
Everybody make me wanna find the nearest door
Always askin' myself, ""What the fuck I really came here for?""
Maybe all I wanted, I've been lookin' for
Lookin' for

[Chorus]
Thought I would regret coming to this party
Empty bottles left, I don't know nobody but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you
People poppin' pills, powder on the counter
Ain't my type of thrill, all these ups and downs but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you

[Bridge]
You don't make me feel stupid for sayin' how I feel
And damn it feels good, damn it feels good to just be real

[Chorus]
I thought I would regret coming to this party
Empty bottles left, I don't know nobody but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you
People poppin' pills, powder on the counter
Ain't my type of thrill, all these ups and downs but
I feel safe with you, I feel safe with you

Circling The Cage,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
Two years go by and
Two breaths and I am
So close to coming down
It’s been a hell of a ride
You’ve been so much of my life
And I don’t wanna hurt you but
You’re still the same and
I just keep changing
And I like who I’m becoming
Growing into my skin
Places I’ve never been

[Chorus]
And I wish I could bring you with me but I can’t
I’m not expecting you to understand
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I, I
The truth is I am better off all by myself
I’m not expecting you to take this well
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I, I
I’m dying to get out

[Verse 2]
Four in the morning, without a warning
It hits me like a wave and I come crumbling down
Thinking ‘bout you not around
I keep going back and forth
I could run forever, never face you myself
I could push you to the edge and probably drag you through hell
But I don’t wanna do that no more
And put you through that no more
I gotta go to shit along

[Chorus]
And I wish I could bring you with me but I can’t
I’m not expecting you to understand
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I, I
The truth is I am better off all by myself
I’m not expecting you to take this well
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I, I
I’m dying to get out

[Bridge]
You’re still the same and
I just keep changing
And I like who I’m becoming
Growing into my skin
Places I’ve never been

[Chorus]
And I wish I could bring you with me but I can’t
I’m not expecting you to understand
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I
The truth is I am better off all by myself
I’m not expecting you to take this well
I’m a butterfly circling the cage right now
Circling the cage and I, I
I’m dying to get out

And I wish I could bring you with me but I can’t

Red,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
I put on my camouflage
I feel you self-sabotage
Fallin' off my tongue goes
Faster when I’m drunk, faster when I fall in love
Now I'm kickin' up the dirt again
And you just wanna make amends
But I fight it like it’s dependent on my life
So I sharpen the knife and let the words fly

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you deserve better
Guess I shoulda warned you ‘bout my temper

[Chorus]
I see red, I see red
I see no yellow, blue, green, or violet
All I see if red in my head
I see red, I see red
There's nothing as vibrant or as violent

[Post-Chorus]
I, red in my, red in my
I see red, I see red
All I see is red in my head
I, red in my, red in my
I see red, I see red
All I see is red in my head

[Verse 2]
I see you waitin' for the storm to pass
But you don't know how long it last
I'm bitin' through my lip
Think, someone steers a ship
While Delaney takes a trip
Now I'm grabbin' at your shirt again
‘Cause I can’t control the state o’m in
It's crimson and it’s blurry
Its the color of my fury
I can feel the blood boilin'

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you, you deserve better
Guess I shoulda warned you ‘bout my temper

[Chorus]
I see red, I see red
I see no yellow, blue, green, or violet
All I see if red in my head
I see red, I see red
There's nothing as vibrant or as violent
All I see is red in my head

[Bridge]
I, I, I, uh
I, I, I, I (Red in the—, red in the—, red in y—)
No yellow, blue, green, or violet
All I see if red in my head
I see red, I see red
There's nothing as vibrant or as violent
All I see is red in my head

[Post-Chorus]
I, red in my, red in my
I see red, I see red
All I see is red in my head
I, red in my, red in my

Happy Song,Delaney Jane,"

The sun shines hella bright
I should be stoked on my life
Don't know what is wrong
But the feeling’s gone

Go out every night
Having the time of my life
But something's wrong
I can't write a happy song

Pressure
So much weight on my back these days
That my neck hurts
How to look, how to act, how to dress
Like a lecture
It’s hard to express how I feel when I'm censored
But you gotta sell records

The sun shines hella bright
I should be stoked on my life
Don't know what is wrong
But the feeling's gone

Go out every night
Having the time of my life
But something's wrong
I can't write a happy song

I can't write a happy song
I can't write a happy

I hate it
See the smile on my face that I make, but it’s painted
It’s a perfectly perfect day but I waste it
Because everyone tells me that you gotta fake it
If you wanna make it

The sun shines hella bright
I should be stoked on my life
Don't know what is wrong
But the feeling’s gone

Go out every night
Having the time of my life
But something's wrong
I can't write a happy song

[Bridge]
If I could get out of my head
I would never feel this way
But for some reason I can't
And it’s never gonna change

If I could get out of my head
I would never feel this way
But for some reason I can't
Do you ever feel the same?

Fuck

I can't write a happy song
I can't write a happy

The sun shines hella bright
I should be stoked on my life
But something's wrong
I guess it's just my happy song

Dear Dad,Delaney Jane,"

Where do I start?
I'll start by saving I love you
Even after my heart keeps taking a beating from you
I never meant to make you
I never meant to make you mad

Where does it end?
I'm tired of carrying this baggage
Ever since we were kids
We just accepted the madness

I never meant to make you
I never meant to make you sad

So tell me you need me
Tell me it's not easy
To carry all the burdens from the past
I wanna believe it
That you really mean it
That's all I ever wanted from you, dad

When I was younger
That's when I needed you most, I
Tried to hold on but got used to watching you go
You never meant to break me
You never meant to break my heart

Now that I'm older
I can see through the chaos
Angel over my shoulder makin' sure I don't stay lost
I'm trying to be somebody
Someone who is happy and free

So tell me you need me
Tell me it's not easy
To carry all the burdens from the past
I want to believe it
That you really mean it
That's all I ever wanted from you, dad

I got feelings and anger and rage
Feels like I've been stuck in a cage
Got all these emotions if you cut me open
You'll see that I'm so much like you
I hate it when we're all divided
And I hate that it's always one sided
I hate every second I've been in this mess
And I hate, I hate that I'll never hate you

So tell me you need me
Tell me it's not easy
To carry all the burdens from the past
I want to believe it
That you really mean it
That's all I ever wanted from you, dad

It's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted
It's all I, It's all I, It's all I
It's all I ever wanted
It's all I ever wanted
It's all I, It's all I, It's all I

That's all I ever wanted from you, dad

Throwback,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1: Delaney Jane]
We were just kids hanging in the suburbs
Walking on a dream
Blood sister to blood brother
We made a pact, kept it under cover
That we'd never love anyone other

[Pre-Chorus: Delaney Jane]
We got lost somewhere, we got lost somehow
Made so many plans that we forgot about
But we can get it back from the lost and found
How about now? How about now?

[Chorus: Delaney Jane & Shaun Frank]
I’ll meet you on the corner with a 40
Hit up East side, heard there's a party
Some good people and some UK vibes
Throw back to London after college where we lost our minds
Singing American Boy like it was back in style
Like it was back in style

[Verse 2: Shaun Frank]
We were just kids moving to the city
You know how it goes
Sometimes it gets so busy
I'll never forget
Mixtapes and fireball whiskey
Crashing on your couch
Damn, you looked so pretty

[Pre-Chorus: Shaun Frank]
We got lost somewhere, we got lost somehow
Made so many plans that we forgot about
But we can get it back from the lost and found
How about now? How about now?

[Chorus: Delaney Jane & Shaun Frank]
I’ll meet you on the corner with a 40
Hit up East side, heard there's a party
Some good people and some UK vibes
Throw back to London after college where we lost our minds

We got lost somewhere, yeah, we got lost somehow
Made so many plans we forgot about
But we can get it back from the lost and found
How about now? How about now?

I'll meet you on the corner with a 40
Hit up East side, heard there's a party

L.U.I.,Delaney Jane,"

[Verse 1]
Eyes closed, I let go
Fuck you for the hell of it
So close to her ghost
Swear I smell her on your skin
Can't hide
'Cause your eyes tell me all the things you did
You don't know what I know
No, you don't know that I know

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama said you weren't a keeper
Shoulda never let you meet her
But it got so much deeper
You're the drug and you're the dealer
Oh, I hate the way I need ya

I swear, eyes blurred
I confess it's dangerous
Loving you under the influence
I swear, eyes blurred
I live with the consequence
Of loving you under the influence

It's late but I wait for another piece of you
I pray for the day that you tell me the truth
Tell me how many others get to have you too?
You don't know what I know
No, you don't know that I know

How long till I let go?
Don't know if I can let go
I chase the feeling just to have my heart drop
You don't know what I know
No, you don't know that I know

My mama said you weren't a keeper
Shoulda never let you meet her
But it got so much deeper
Oh, I hate the way I need ya

There Goes My Innocence,Delaney Jane,"

When I was a little girl I had all these dreams of the world
And I thought, well I can't wait to be a grown up
So I can date, so I can kiss the boys and we can play with each other's toys
I guess I just wanted affection, I just wanted a little protection
But boys will be boys
And a boy is not a man
But I was too young to know this
Too naive to understand
That you give em' an inch, they'll take a mile
Laugh at you while you cry in a pile
And all you can think is that you'd rather die
Cause the truth is you're already dead inside

There's goes my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah
There's goes my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah

When I was fourteen you stole my virginity
I was too drunk to scream and way too scared to make a scene
I went to a river party (yeah)
And I followed him down the path (yeah)
He laid me on the gravel and he fucked me just like that
The rest is a little blurry
But I think I blocked it out
Like a scene in a movie you cover your eyes so you don't have to live through the shame and the blame
And I doubt it didn't happen
Cause it fucked me up for years
Turned me into someone who lives on edge everyday in fear
And I know I appear to be okay now
And I guess I made it this far
But the truth is I bury my burdens, they never stop hurting
It's only a matter of time, 'til you see all my scars, 'til i paint them on my canvas
And if you relate then you feel the hate towards the ones who take advantage

There's goes my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah
There's goes my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah, my innocence yeah

"
If I Died,Delaney Jane,"

Maybe If I died
And came back to life
You will look at me the way you did before
Before I was yours
Before you were mine
'Cause I don't feel those hungry eyes anymore

And it's hard for me to find the words to say
When I'm afraid that nothing's ever gonna change

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Remember when we met
You were just a friend
But you chased me like I was a piece of heaven
And I warned you first
That I wouldn't be easy to love, no
Everybody tells me I'm too much
But you wouldn't let me go, yeah

It's hard for me to up and walk away
When I know my love for you has never changed

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Kiss me like you mean it
Hold me like you're scared to let me go
You change like the seasons
Show me you're the man I used to know

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Would you miss me?

Maybe if I died you would finally see
All of me
Every little piece of me
Maybe if I died you would finally see
You miss me
Or maybe you'd be fine

Would you miss me?
Maybe you'd be fine

Every Word,Matt Lange,"

Canada
Is such a distant memory
We wore red pants, hearts on our sleeves
At a shitty dive bar

You took your stand
We put our distance between us
I met her, and you met him
But here we are now

LA called
You said you're following your dreams
And every night I dreamt of you
Brought you here

Take me in
I can heal your wounded eyes
Inside our dark paradise
Diamonds everywhere

[Chorus]
Consider this
No matter how far I fall
You pick me up when even though
You're not here

Consider this
No matter how dark I turn
You give me hope when even though
You're still there

[Bridge]
So close now
I can taste your lips on mine
I'll be yours and you'll be fine
For forever

Consider this
I'm falling down by your side
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
For forever
For forever

[Chorus]
Consider this
No matter how far I fall
You pick me up when even though
You're not here

Consider this
No matter how dark I turn
You give me hope when even though
You're still there

Consider this...
Consider this...

Cut My Lip,X Lovers,"

[Verse 1]
I cut my lip just for fun
To prove that you is the one
But you were gone in the morning
And now my heart weighs a ton, yeah
I burned my house to the ground (Ground)

But you were gone in the morning
And now my world's upside down

And who was granting you
Wishes when you was down in the ditches
You know, yeah, yeah

Sweatshirt,X Lovers,"

I find a place inside my sweatshirt that beats all reality
Oh and you could probably try but you would not understand me
I wake up early, wash up, call straight to my mother, yeah
'Cause she knows what I'm going through like no one other

A confirmation, a perfect match
One conversation, two steps back
The loudest silence, is the loneliest truth
I feel the furthest when I lay right next to you

In 4,NoCap,"

[Intro]
Ayy
(Kane did it, ho)

[Verse]
This mornin', I brushed my teeth, I grabbed my Glock off the hotel stand
Shot my mama a text, ""Thanks for makin’ me a man""
I stopped by Dillard's, grabbed a pack of Polo t-shirts
They were slim fit, I got a slim bitch
But that ain't my bitch, don’t even know why I mentioned this
Then I hit up John Popi, got a zip of biscotti
They painted up my billboard, they did some hella climbin'
Got me back and forth to court 'bout somethin' I want behind me
The opps, they know where I'm at, but they won't come and find me
The opps, they know where I'm at, it ain't like I’m hidin’
I tried to spare 'em, tried to look over the biggest shit
If I put down my remote, then Lil Joe gon’ click
Tie him up on speakerphone, let his mama hear it
I'll kill his whole crew and still be on some humble shit
And I get fly as hell especially in an orange fit
These niggas must die and I ain't talkin' armpits
And I need y’all to stop comparin' me, your favorite rapper flow from me
These rappers not approachin' me but I hear that it's smoke with me
But tell them if they want to kill me (Ayy)
Tell them that it won't be easy
I ride with Drakes like I'm Lil Weezy
And I still feel like somethin' missing
I'm forever reppin' 16
They ain't got no problem with riskin' life for me
I shine with no problem, that's why they really hate me
""More money, more problems"" prolly the realest statement
I just talked to Lil Durk, it was 'bout real estate
I want a lil' more paper but rappin' got me straight
Everything ain't good, I still wanna see better days
Disrespect the dead, seen burnt flowers on Fred grave
And I could never respond, they blow up what I say
I seen death around the corner and went the other way
They ain't picture me comin', in my dreams I see me runnin' up on them
With the stick, box him right in the corner I ain't talkin' McGregor
I just checked a hundred racks on my schedule
Hate, I ain't responding now, you niggas can't even get to my level
I already fucked the bitch way before I even had met her
I just got in the game, they watched me go put flawless on metal
Ayy, really ride with 9's, I don't pretend
Ayy, I just bought Versace just to sleep in
Ayy, your dead homie's somethin' I don't know about
But if his killer go to jail, I'm tryna bond him out
Might have some babies in your crib 'cause we gon' come inside
We want your casket closed so all we know is open fire (Ayy)
Slim left, that's why I tote this gun on my right hip
If he hops, death be comin' right behind him like an ad-lib
You gon' have to fake your death, I'm tellin' you, for real, it's gon' get that real
It's so easy to lose like car keys
Ended my night with red and RP's at the studio
I'm happy that I got a soul that I ain't never sold
Havin' sex with hoes who wouldn't fuck me like a year ago
I'm dressin' rich, but the inside of me still broke
Know I'm a rapper, still got niggas I'd kill for
Get real high, I get booted up like steel toes
I'm in too, thought I'd give you some of this info
Know you want some, tell me, nigga, what you in for?

Ayy

[Chorus]
If they really had love, they would've showed me
They hate what I'm doin' now, they would love to see the old me
If I gotta go back to jail, I know my family straight
If I gotta go back to jail, I know my lawyer paid (Ayy)
I burn this money, burn this fame, I'll still be the same nigga
Take off this watch, take off this chain, I'll still be the same nigga

[Verse]
Ayy, came home from jail, took rappin' serious, I had to make my own decision
He prolly ain't fuckin' with me 'cause he know he ain't fuckin' with me
In the booth right now, I'm off a pill, if I ain't do nothin', I kept it real
My heart'll prolly get me killed (Ayy, ayy)
Permanent, this ain't no grill, sometimes I wish that C-Lo lived
Sometimes I wish that Fred was here (Ayy, ayy)
Crawford still up seven years, Lil Joe had come home from a year
I told him it was up from here (Ayy)
She wanted Percocets, I gave her all Xans
They tried to hold me back, but it was God-planned
Hate the position that I'm in, they sayin' anything
It was far away, I didn't see it, I watched the closest change
They prolly just rappin', I really got niggas in the can
They prolly just rappin', I really got some dead friends (Ayy)
I'm cryin' fire, feel like my tears burnin'
Know the streets got rules, how the hell you turnin'?
Tell the opps I got some paper, I hope that they don't make me spend it
Trap house, it was vacant, we still got some paper in it
Same conversation, just different locations
When it's smoke, don't leave a witness, we just leavin' shell casings
Not on the mic, then I'm in the hood
With all my jewelry on and my pockets full
Totin' poles, not the ones come from Magic
I made it out, I know the devil thought he had me

[Chorus]
If they really had love, they would've showed me
They hate what I'm doin' now, they would love to see the old me
If I gotta go back to jail, I know my family straight
If I gotta go back to jail, I know my lawyer paid (Ayy)
I burn this money, burn this fame, I'll still be the same nigga
Take off this watch, take off this chain, I'll still be the same nigga

What You Know,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(Yung Ting, you goin' crazy)

[Chorus]
I'ma let the jeweler come tape my wrists
What you know 'bout chances and takin' risks?
What you know 'bout takin' care of your homies doin' years? Huh?
What you know, nigga? What you know, nigga?
My niggas in the pen, but I keep lead
Tired of the same nigga, he ain't change yet
Do my own drugs and then I fade off (Ayy)
Hate is in the air just like a coin toss (Ayy)
NoCap, he got rich and start ignorin' y'all (Ayy)
And my bank account look like a phone number (Ayy)
Police at my door, I don't wanna talk
I rep that bird, they say, ""We know you a gang member""

[Verse 1]
My shoes cost a car note and your rent together
They might not feel my new shit, I'm on another level
I'm fuckin' on a white bitch, she a fan of Clever
Codeine in my tea, hope I don't waste it in a Tesla
If I shoot my shot, I bet I wet her
They don't know the times I was slidin' with Mega
If Fred wasn't dead, we'd probably be together
Pissin' haters off, my next chain gon' be yellow
I don't think I could get realer (Ayy)
Then I think I would get real love
Put her face up in a pillow
Dick her down and I get rid of her

[Chorus]
I'ma let the jeweler come tape my wrists
What you know 'bout chances and takin' risks?
What you know 'bout takin' care of your homies doin' years? Huh?
What you know, nigga? What you know, nigga?
My niggas in the pen, but I keep lead
Tired of the same nigga, he ain't change yet
Do my own drugs and then I fade off (Ayy)
Hate is in the air just like a coin toss (Ayy)
NoCap, he got rich and start ignorin' y'all (Ayy)
And my bank account look like a phone number (Ayy)
Police at my door, I don't wanna talk
I rep that bird, they say, ""We know you a gang member""

[Verse 2]
She straight up out the 'jects, yeah, put her in a foreign
Supply all the ammo to 1600 army
I didn't fuck that ho because I knew she wasn't worth me
Fake love, real hate, I do not know which one is worse to me
Go, go, go, go, I just want you to be, yeah (Ayy)
You don't know my story, I wish that y'all can see half
My lyrics, breakin' out of rehab, my flow dope, nigga
No money, still runnin' with my old niggas
I can't forget I'm still dealin' with my old issues
I'm thinkin' deep, one day we all gotta go, nigga
How the fuck you let that hate sit in your soul, nigga?
Even all them times that I was tired, I still rode with you
I'm off Roxies and I ain't never seen Tigger

So don't nobody move tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Good nigga did some shit up in the past that he don't wanna mention
His partner died right in front of him, he ain't been the same since
He beefin' and he out on bond, but he ain't trippin' he still wanna spin it
Thinkin' back, he seen like seven homies gone who he won't see again
Them pistols on him dirty, but he still won't trade 'em
His baby mama trippin', say she need a lil' paper
He don't know what to do, he walk back and forth pacin'
He say before he sell 'em, it'll be home invasion
The hood familiar with the kid, he the heart of the south
And he don't know who killed his brother, murder still unsolved
His uncle put his cousin on, he thinkin' 'bout takin' him off
His cousin serve him all the time, he know his sack in his drawers
His cousin serve him all the time, he know the racks in the car
It's kinda easy, he be high, he always lackin' on bars
Somebody loves you
I know what you goin' through
You need someone to talk to
Weight of the world is on you

[Verse 2]
You catch one more felony, then you doin' life
I'm just tryna preach and tell you that it's more to life
You tryna change, but they still hold you on your past life
Ain't ate in days, you're stressin', fuckin' up your appetite
Asked God once, you said, ""Fuck it, I'ma ask him twice""
If you ask a third time, you know that you not askin' nice
Cousin gave you one dime, why the fuck he got on all this ice?
His uncle taxin' him, give his cousin a better price
If he hit this one lick, he feel like his whole future bright
Never worked on calls, but the ghetto left him traumatized
Before he know it, his uncle pullin' up on him
And droppin' ten bags off, he ain't know that was comin'
He feelin' good, he been hustlin', gave his girl a lil' money
Said he gon' die or go to jail, they try to take somethin' from him
He had found out who killed his brother, he put like two of 'em under
Thoughts on robbin' unc' and cuz, but he had love for both of 'em (So that's all)

[Chorus]
Load up, young nigga, load up, young nigga
Load up, young nigga, load
Pour up one, nigga, pour up one, nigga
Pour up one, nigga, pour
Roll up, young nigga, roll up, young nigga

Catch a nigga like I'm Randy Moss, I'm dope just like the '80s
Bitch, I only beat your back, you can't have my babies
Old money shit like ages, my niggas in the pen so I can't erase it
Pull up in an old school, still can race it
Four broads like Stunna Vegas
No Georgia, I'm money makin', she get no ring like Undertaker
I do not write my raps, but I love paper
That shit tatted on my face, I just love haters
That shit tatted on my face, I just hate love

[Chorus]
It seem like we dyin' to live life (Ayy)
Bodies be droppin' like flies (Ayy)
Promethazine on ice (Ayy)
She fuckin', she don't think twice (Ayy)
Rap nigga, still hang around robbers (Ayy)
Rap nigga, still hang around choppers (Ayy)
Send him to the grave, we won't let him see the doctor (Ayy)
If we never see him, we gon' pull up on his partners

Take Care,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(SephGotTheWaves)

[Chorus]
Yeah, drippin' in Hermes, hope she don’t tell
Drippin' in Chanel, it don't go on sale (Ayy)
Watch me burn this cash like I don’t care
Yeah
You say you gettin' money, but I can't tell
First, I was broke, they didn't hit me on my Nextel
The party don't start until I get there
I'll bag that lil' boy up like an Arab

[Verse]
Left all my old friends and told 'em, ""Take care""
I didn’t have time for ’em, so I'ma buy a Richard Mille
I used to pray for times like this, I really reached a mil’
That plate was way over there, I had to reach a meal
Don't know why the hell I thought Fred wouldn't leave here
I'm havin’ withdrawals, I really can't get off these pills
I always hear they envy, hate just can't get off my ear
I'm countin' checks since I know how a broke nigga feel
God is the only man that I fear
Cameras on that new whip, so I ain't really gotta watch the rear
Fake busters, left 'em all 'cause my watch was real
My bitch ain't O'Neal, but I really hope she kill for me

[Chorus]
Yeah, drippin' in Hermes, hope she don't tell
Drippin' in Chanel, it don't go on sale (Ayy)
Watch me burn this cash like I don't care
Yeah
You say you gettin' money, but I can't tell
First, I was broke, they didn't hit me on my Nextel
The party don't start until I get there
I'll bag that lil' boy up like an Arab

Bankroll,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(That shit gon' be crazy, Jacc)

[Chorus]
Ayy, money on my head, still ride with the top off
Really came from shit, now a lil' nigga big boss
I was on the phone every time it was shots called
Why the fuck I'ma speak if a nigga don't know y'all?
Hit him twenty-one times, like tunk
I ain't got a ho card, uh-uh
If it ain't OG, it's Runtz
Know the hood tried to lose me; we won
I got on two Rollies, still don't know what time it is
I do not know what I spent on designer gifts
Pitchin' out death threats, we get 'em out of here
Hope she got insurance, I hit her from the rear
I rock Alexander, ignorin' dancers
She know she won't see me again
She told me put it on camera (Ayy)
I told her, ""Thanks"" for her manners

[Verse]
Niggas know it's like Chiraq up in that field
I'm thuggin', I'm still riskin' my career
Tote more sticks than North Korea
12 had did a sweep, too many vacuum seals
He not a gangsta, he just react up off of fear
The neighborhood doctor, you feel me?
I'm turnin' my problems to millions
You die if you jump in that water
You cannot swim where the sharks at
Vacant, but I'm hearin' voices
Slime, it can get poisoned
Nigga, you wasn't with me way way back when I was dead broke
When I couldn't make a sack turn even with a telescope

[Chorus]
Ayy, money on my head, still ride with the top off
Really came from shit, now a lil' nigga big boss
I was on the phone every time it was shots called
Why the fuck I'ma speak if a nigga don't know y'all?
Hit him twenty-one times, like tunk
I ain't got a ho card, uh-uh
If it ain't OG, it's Runtz
Know the hood tried to lose me; we won
I got on two Rollies, still don't know what time it is
I do not know what I spent on designer gifts
Pitchin' out death threats, we get 'em out of here
Hope she got insurance, I hit her from the rear

Shots Fired,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(Danny, I see you)
(Go 'head, O)

[Chorus]
Paul Walker livin', all my niggas so reckless
Pull up Hellcat, but I hope my dawgs get to Heaven
Tryna stay alive, but I been countin' dead faces
Ride for you like a Durango, graveyard bankroll
Even though my name NoCap, it ain't nowhere I can't go
Yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yeah
All them bullets got to choppin', it was shots fired (Ayy)

[Verse]
Still wouldn't point no fingers if I had a damn appointment
Extra horses in the whip, I'm from the country
I was broke and found out it ain't nothin' important than money
Did everything for the pain, but it took codeine to numb me
In the Hill like Tyreek, rainbow Rolex; Tekashi
I let the neighborhood wear this watch
Damn, hope ain't nobody else saw me
I never drunk no wine, damn, but I still ride around with this 40
Masked up, go in the house when the car leave
On the block servin' nicks, on my hip, that's a cannon
My heart can't be fixed by a mechanic
All you niggas rats, mouses rattin'
I kill 'em with bars, keep up with the Xanax
Never keep dope where you always stay at
I'm still countin' money off cameras
I got honchos, even off the set
It could be worse, pray for the best and bow your heads

[Chorus]
Paul Walker livin', all my niggas so reckless
Pull up Hellcat, but I hope my dawgs get to Heaven
Tryna stay alive, but I been countin' dead faces
Ride for you like a Durango, graveyard bankroll
Even though my name NoCap, it ain't nowhere I can't go
Yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh)
Yeah
All them bullets got to choppin', it was shots fired

(CashMoneyAP)
(Chapo)

[Chorus: NoCap]
Ayy, shawty had walked in and her whole crew was full of bad bitches
They say they ain't bougie, they just do not fuck with sad bitches
She know she bad as hell, spent some racks to get her ass did
Put down Gucci for Chanel, I don't know, she just brag different
Look at how she drop it, then her friend lift it
If they stop printin' money today, she gon' still get it
That bitch don't really want you, nigga, she just deal with it
I popped them Perkys yesterday and I'm still itchin'

[Verse 1: NoCap]
He just caught a body, he still itchin'
Fuck my ex, I'm happy Ty see me on
Get him first, the type of time I be on
For Brianna, I go over, beyond
Who woulda thought that I would be on?
Snakes in the grass, I been mowin' my lawn
Weed in my kidney, got codeine in my lungs
Lost my nigga last week, I just can't stay strong

[Chorus: NoCap]
Ayy, shawty had walked in and her whole crew was full of bad bitches
They say they ain't bougie, they just do not fuck with sad bitches

I popped them Perkys yesterday and I'm still itchin'

[Verse 2: Quando Rondo]
The opps know I'm the sickest, I'm so ill with it
Last year on codeine, I spent a meal ticket (Skrrt)
I might have a son and name him Lil Richie (Yeah)
I put two titties on the Glock, not talkin' Wendy Williams (Yeah)
Two-door coupe, drop-top, ride through, the opps look 'cause they scared of me
I told that bitch, ""Call me QPac"", rhat Quando Rondo dude so dead to me
I'm screamin', ""Free Ralo the Ahk"" even though I'm rockin' Christian Lou'
She know that all y'all niggas flawed, no, she don't fuck with artificial dudes (Skrrt)
Foot on the pedal, do the dash, up the metal and blow
Rich forever, on the song, yeah, I used Rich The Kid's flow
Her pussy good so I'ma fly her from the Bay to the Pote
She love to brag, she got a bag, she drippin' head to her toe
I woulda gave that boy my last but I can't fuck with lil' bro
It hurt my heart that you a rat, you 'posed to stick to the code
And don't you think because you post me as your MCM
That I'ma buy you MCM, you gotta fuck me in the Timbs

[Chorus: NoCap]
Ayy, shawty had walked in and her whole crew was full of bad bitches

Heaven Gates,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(Ayy bro, is that Jambo?)

[Chorus]
Let all the real ones in and close the Heaven gates
Tomorrow never comes, so love me yesterday
When you spell ""love"" your ""O"" is lowercase
Me leavin' and they change is the worst case
I blow out all the fire like it's my birthday
Like Derek Jeter, everything I did was unsafe
If this money cannot buy your heart, I know that I can rent it
I know this paper might drive me insane, without a speed limit
If you take too long to ask me, I might lie
I'm livin' wrong, I got this pistol on my right side

[Verse 1]
It's like my life been movin' fast, my niggas dyin' slowly
Mark ain't ever comin' home, he tried to kill the police
I know that police comin' home if he ever kill me
You might drown in my songs 'cause my lyrics real deep
I'm blind countin' blue hunnids, rest in peace Nipsey
If my fans never touch me, I bet they feel me
The world was sleepin' on me, who had bought the earth the onesie

[Bridge]
Motives...
What is yours? What is yours?
What is yours? What is yours?
What's up with your new shit? Tryna figure who you is
Whatever you do fine, I hope you don't lose it
What is yours? What is yours?

[Verse 2]
I be high thinkin' 'bout C-Lo
So I don't shoot craps no more
Before my eyes, I seen the hate start to unfold
Bunch of secrets, I got stories that are untold
Ball with my brothers, mama shoulda named me Lonzo
Even when I'm off the set, a nigga still countin' hunchos
I got brothers on the block and they get packs like Mutombo
Tell my life on the phone, it was micro, not Boost Mobile
Everything ain't the same
Livin' like I robbed a bank
Dead homies not around, it's strange
Unexpected separation
If it ain't a problem, then we gon' make one
I'm too humble, I been workin' on my arrogance
They down in the dirt, so let us put our prayers up

[Chorus]
Let all the real ones in and close the Heaven gates
Tomorrow never comes, so love me yesterday
When you spell ""love"" your ""O"" is lowercase
Me leavin' and they change is the worst case
I blow out all the fire like it's my birthday
Like Derek Jeter, everything I did was unsafe
If this money cannot buy your heart, I know that I can rent it
I know this paper might drive me insane, without a speed limit
If you take too long to ask me, I might lie
I'm livin' wrong, I got this pistol on my right side

Same Thing,NoCap,"

[Intro]
(KimJ with the heat)
(Rude Dolph)

[Chorus]
Old money like some dinosaurs
Was takin' losses that we couldn't afford
Tried to hold me back when I was movin' forward
I want that cash, I'm always movin' for it
She gon' fuck me for some Tom Ford
Brand new Rolex, ain't got time for her
1600 block, they know I rep that gang gang
You got shooters? Me too, guess we on the same thing
Don't let this rappin' fool you, bitch, I'm on the same thing
Every time they came and got me, I ain't say a name
Niggas thought I hung with Weezy, I keep this MAC, mane
Bitch had gave it to me easy when them racks came

[Verse]
Gunshots went through Fred's chest
One bullet hit Slim's head
Some of 'em say I changed, but if I did, I changed for the better
Most of you niggas stopped cheesin' soon as I got some cheddar
Nigga, this shit won't never heal, stop askin' is I'm feelin' better
I don't get on elevators, everybody 'round me steppers
High as hell eatin' beats, shit reminded me of edibles
I'ma kill Slim's killer, hopin' 12 sit back, I'm catchin' him
Just spent a hunnid racks, I'm ballin' out
I'm on a whole 'nother level now
Straight out the hood, but I been sellin' out
Shows, need twenty racks to hop on the road
Get rid of the 'script bottle, make sure that it's already poured
The whole van on probation, we can't get pulled over
My new bitch told me she loved me, I just shrugged my shoulders
I don't play no games, you better act like you supposed to
Would you still love me if I never met Pro Tools?
I promise I ain't fussin', just remember what I told you
Buildin' trust again is some shit I can't get close to
Really then again, you someone I wanna be close to, yeah
Dick you down like I'm supposed to, yeah
These choppers kick harder than Goku, yeah
Five hundred on the vest, but I'm not protected
Sound weird, but that's how a nigga dressin'
Spikes all on my wrist, I'm high as it gets
Sometimes I feel like Drizzy, I was rollin' through the 6
She say she not a fan, but she keep askin' for a pic
My niggas rich, if she was a cornerback, she still couldn't pick
My blunt is lit, my gun a stick
Pull up Hellcat, no, I'm not kiddin'
Diamonds got my wrists numb, short bitch look like Nia Long
We don't talk on cell phones, eyes lower than Vietnam
Who the fuck gon' save the streets if I didn't?
Never said, ""No"" to my niggas or my kin
Stand on these niggas' heads like bobby pins
You get one thing free in this life: oxygen
I seen flaw in a rap nigga, I won't put him on aux again
I think my niggas send more shots than Kentucky college gym
I got real-life issues, can't talk too much on interviews
Domestic violence on codeine, these drugs really get abused

[Chorus]
Old money like some dinosaurs
Was takin' losses that we couldn't afford
Tried to hold me back when I was movin' forward
I want that cash, I'm always movin' for it
She gon' fuck me for some Tom Ford
Brand new Rolex, ain't got time for her
1600 block, they know I rep that gang gang
You got shooters? Me too, guess we on the same thing
Don't let this rappin' fool you, bitch, I'm on the same thing

The Way It Is,NoCap,"

[Chorus]
I'ma put the gang on hits
Make sure that we all get rich (Ayy)
Niggas wanna kill me at the crib (Ayy)
That's just the way it is
I was trappin' way before they signed me
Ayy, I'm dyin' if a nigga try me
All these niggas 'round me real slimey
Shop for opp niggas, then we buying

[Verse 1]
I can see the hate as I wear these Cartiers
I can see the envy, I can see it so clear
Blood in my eyes, I was still droppin' tears, oh
All these diamonds, still remind myself
They not with me, I'll remain myself
These Giuseppes, please mind my step
Have you seen a nigga prayin' to the devil
I made a wrong decision, they put my sister in jail
Crawford, boy, he free, his mind still in the cell
If you don't give 'em what they want, the love'll never be real
A nigga lit, I just bought a couple sticks and...

[Chorus]
I'ma put the gang on hits
Make sure that we all get rich (Ayy)
Niggas wanna kill me at the crib (Ayy)
That's just the way it is
I was trappin' way before they signed me
Ayy, I'm dyin' if a nigga try me
All these niggas 'round me real slimey
Shop for opp niggas, then we buying (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
Dreams I was rich but I kept wakin' up with shit
Now I can buy a car with what I spent at Saks Fifth
Every day is murder in my city, it's that real
Tell me you love me and I'll respond, ""Oh, is that real?""
I tote a gun still, I still would drop these shells
X a nigga's son out, I still would drop these shells
Every time I went to jail, I bet I made a bail
Only time I ain't make a bail is when them crackers held me
I'm the youngest shark, I'm on Adderall
I drive the fastest cars, fuck the baddest broads
She gon' fuck the squad, she don't have a choice
For the right prices, shooters Mike Tyson

[Chorus]
I'ma put the gang on hits
Make sure that we all get rich (Ayy)
Niggas wanna kill me at the crib (Ayy)
That's just the way it is
I was trappin' way before they signed me
Ayy, I'm dyin' if a nigga try me
All these niggas 'round me real slimey
Shop for opp niggas, then we buying

[Chorus]
Country boy, them young bulls tote guitars
Make sure my life enjoyed, I know I got a bunch of problems
Country boy, his whole life is full of dirt roads
Country boy, F-150s and Durangos
Skrrt, zoom
Skrrt, boom
All them cars got extra horses
When you rich, you become a target

[Verse 1]
But these bullets came from Academy
Remember ballin', playin' 21 with my savages
I couldn't find no Percocets, I had to pop a Addy
If it's smoke, we gon' address it, drop the addy
Put it in the bank so goddamn long, I forgot I had it
Caught an opp lackin' in traffic, he was in a Caddy
I don't really like to talk, I'd rather put it on the microphone
If my nigga get a bond like Barry, I'ma make sure that he comin' home
I'm paid, paid, paid
I had to make a way
A bunch of chains on me
A bunch had changed on me

[Chorus]
Country boy, them young bulls tote guitars
Make sure my life enjoyed, I know I got a bunch of problems
Country boy, his whole life is full of dirt roads
Country boy, F-150s and Durangos
Skrrt, zoom
Skrrt, boom
All them cars got extra horses
When you rich, you become a target

[Verse 2]
I was trappin', then became an artist
Don't judge me, you better know
If you bring your friends, you sharin' those
Pickup truck, busted windows
Double R, dusted windows
They copy my flow like 10-4
Out in Cali smokin' indo
They in the pen, so I buy pencils
Won't you let me know?
It ain't the same, and I can vouch for that
Bullshit rappers wasn't talkin' pain, I brought the real back
Put like four grams in the 'Wood, that's a real Back
Fell in love with dually trucks and Hellcats

[Chorus]
Country boy, them young bulls tote guitars
Make sure my life enjoyed, I know I got a bunch of problems
Country boy, his whole life is full of dirt roads
Country boy, F-150s and Durangos
Skrrt, zoom

All them cars got extra horses
When you rich, you become a target

Rollin' through the bottom, tryna knock a nigga top off
Ain't tryna go to jail, we tryna leave that nigga unsolved
I know I'm a dog, so I'm ridin' with the roof off
Ayy, I'm harder than hard, it's not a facade
Fuck it, I'm the realest nigga in it (Ayy)
This a Percocet, bitch, this ain't no Xanax (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm outer space, I'm so close to planets

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and I'm fly as hell, I ain't close to landin'
She suck my dick so good, she gon' make me kill her family
When them bullets got to hittin', niggas started dancin'
When them bullets got to hittin', niggas went to prayin'
Margiela cost me fifteen
I don't know her name, so I guessed and called her Britney
Ain't turnin' myself in, the police gotta come and get me (Ayy)
Murder eczema, it's like my trigger finger itchin'
I think all my opps be snitchin'

[Chorus]
Ayy, Rolex on, no chain, slidin' with the doors off
Rollin' through the bottom, tryna knock a nigga top off
Ain't tryna go to jail, we tryna leave that nigga unsolved

Ayy, I'm harder than hard, it's not a facade
Fuck it, I'm the realest nigga in it (Ayy)
This a Percocet, bitch, this ain't no Xanax (Ayy)
Bitch, I'm outer space, I'm so close to planets

[Verse 2]
Once I tell my niggas, ""Go,"" it ain't no stoppin' 'em
Them boys be ready to kill your mama, they get to poppin' shit
Them boys be ready to kill your mama and kill your pops and shit
We hit the scene with the F&N, that was not a stick
They wish I still was broke, they didn't imagine this
Double clip, we be pullin' up with MACs and shit
Project bitch, her friends pullin' up with bats and shit
I'm cuttin' ties, but these guns got attachments

[Chorus]
Ayy, Rolex on, no chain, slidin' with the doors off
Rollin' through the bottom, tryna knock a nigga top off
Ain't tryna go to jail, we tryna leave that nigga unsolved

First Day In,NoCap,"

[Intro]

Turnin' myself in tomorrow
I know I might wake up in my cell and try to put my chain on
Probably my watch too
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Rockin' all these chains, it ain't nothin' to it
Racks up in the bank, it ain't nothin' to it, nigga
Really, shit ain't changed, I just got a lil' bigger
I feel 'em actin' strange, I might kill one of my niggas, yeah

[Chorus]
Safe to say, I'm on the road to riches
I know it's roadblocks
Safe to say, I'm on the road to riches
A couple stop signs

[Verse]
Turned myself in in Off-White
Tell myself that it's alright
Kept a gun on my hip wide
You wouldn't make it on my side
Rolex water like I baptized it
My hood hot, but it's worse than ISIS
Niggas in the box like they Mike Tyson
I know that I ain't perfect
You ain't gotta go home just to get behind these curtains
NoCap made the wave, all these rappers started surfin'
Smile's on my face when I'm sad and I'm hurtin'
I been had lost my feelings back when Fred got murdered
Seen a nigga dissin' me on the internet today
I ain't let him hang around me, I guess he felt played
I can't join him, go against him, it was all in his face
Stayin' strong, stayin' humble, you don't know what it take
Niggas try me every day and them niggas turn haters
I let 'em try, you don't know how many times I tried to save 'em
Me and ghetto got the struggle, got the same prayers
In the hood, don't know how to leave
It's a crime that nobody seen
If I'm crying, don't let nobody see me
Ayy, I think all these niggas wanna be me
No regrets, I had my own reasons
Chase that money, I want my own region
Started ballin', wrong ones started playin' defense on me
You don't wanna see me with that bag, huh?
Treat that coupe just like a app, I'm quick to crash on you
He thought that I was just a rapper but I was his land owner
I get fly, fly, fly, you better hope that I don't land on you, hey
For the right, right price, I'll put your own mans on you
1600, I'ma stand on it

[Pre-Chorus]
Rockin' all these chains, it ain't nothin' to it
Racks up in the bank, it ain't nothin' to it, nigga
Really, shit ain't changed, I just got a lil' bigger
I feel 'em actin' strange, I might kill one of my niggas, yeah

[Chorus]
Safe to say, I'm on the road to riches
I know it's roadblocks
Safe to say, I'm on the road to riches
A couple stop signs

Turned myself in in Off-White
Tell myself that it's alright

Ghetto Angels (feat. Lil Durk & Jagged Edge) - Remix,NoCap,"

[Verse 1: NoCap]
Yeah, didn't write this song, but I'm recordin' with this lead on me
Know it sound strange, but I'ma die for all my dead homies
Nobody really know how he feels
I always thought that you would be here
Why do I always question God, but I never pray?
I think about you, I end up cryin' on my best days
Tryna convince me to get better, naw, naw, naw, naw
I'd be lyin' if I didn't say I really miss my dawgs
It's so much of pain in us, always feel like I'm givin' up
It ain't the same no more, death brought me anger
I'm followed by angels and I got some dyin' love
Soon as I got rich, soon as I got famous

[Chorus: NoCap]
Why did you leave?
If you was here, how would it be?
Oh, woah
I'm protected by these ghetto angels
Oh, woah
I'm protected by the hood gangstas

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
When the streets don't show you love, that feelin' a bitch, ain't it?
When a nigga die, the world make fun, that feelin' sick, ain't it?
I'm from Chicago where they turn your death date to an occasion
You hear the same shit when a nigga die they say it's under investigation
You'll find the killer who killed my cousin, find the killer who killed Kenneka Jenkins
That's why they slide without thinkin', nobody safe when I'm breathin' (Oh)
I'm the voice of the streets, I ain't tryna be the big homie
Other cities got structure, Chicago ain't got big homies
Havin' your gun on you everyday, that shit don't mean shit, don't it?
It's who got the ups first, my cousin died with a stick on him
I don't see no lies in here, I feel like cryin' in here
He spent his life on securities, he got life, he cryin' for real
He say I'll give you this pain through
They lost they souls to the streets, but they my ghetto angels
NoCap, the streets wanna hear me on this remix, they wanna hear my pain too
I seen Amir's body in Miami, I text, ""I hope this ain't you""
I wanna call and say...

[Chorus: NoCap & Brandon Casey]
Why did you leave?
If you was here, how would it be?
Oh, woah
I'm protected by these ghetto angels (By these angels, yeah)
Oh, woah
I'm protected by the hood gangstas (Yeah, all my gangstas)

[Verse 3: Brandon Casey]
I thank God that I'm still here
I'm faced with all the bull-ish
Maybe lessons from the pulpit
Are the blessings from the highest
Yeah, you just don't know, no
You should never have to see your homie drop, that's a lot
When you walkin' for this life, who knows when it stops
Oh, no
No, oh

[Verse 4: Brian Casey]
Gotta give it straight, true with no chase
I never question God, I know it's a better place
I know it's a marathon, not just a race
Can't wait to see the looks on all my homies' faces
Can't wait until the day that we embrace (Oh)
(Ooh, woah)
Can't wait until the day that we embrace (Ooh, oh)

[Chorus: NoCap & Brandon Casey]
Yeah, why did you leave?
If you was here, how would it be?
Oh, woah
I'm protected by these ghetto angels
Oh, woah
I'm protected by the hood gangstas (All my gangstas)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Oh, woah)

Cap A Lot,Fredo Bang,"

[Intro]
Yo
B-Eazy, that's my slime

[Chorus]
Yeah, these days, niggas like to cap a lot (Cap a lot)
Bandana wrapped around the Glock, I call it 'Pac (Call it 'Pac)
Yeah, yeah, take the murder rate and push it up a notch
Yeah, yeah, dissing in them songs what got your brother shot

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got a gangsta' bitch, I make her fuck the opps (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause when she fucking on ya, she gon' send the drop (Yeah, yeah)
I slang iron, but I like to rap a lot, yeah (Okay)
I got mob ties, just like Rap-a-Lot, yeah
I keep a stick, my heart cold, popsicle (Poppa', poppa')
Hollow tips make a nigga do the Wiggle (Yeah)
Catch your shooter, bend him up, we make him cripple (Skrr, skrr, bow, bow)
I dream of murder, got a Glock under my pillow
I drop a bag and tell Osama, ""Fuck it up"" (Yeah, yeah)
Bullets hit the stomach, give him bubble guts (Yeah, yeah)
Niggas wanna try me but don't got the guts (Yeah, yeah)
'Cause they know talkin' fly can get your feathers plucked (Yeah)
Grab the stick and burn a nigga like chlamydia
Play with me, my shooters come and fuck the city up (Fuck that nigga)
Rappers like to ride dick, tell 'em, ""Giddy up"" (Bitch)
Don't trust a bitch, got my stick fuckin' on a slut
I been puttin' that iron on nigga's back since Bebo (Bebo)
This is not a Smith and Wesson, this a Draco (This a Draco, bitch)
They say them niggas stacking bodies just like Legos
Take you out for the cream, that's a Maxo

[Chorus]
These days, niggas like to cap a lot
These—these days, niggas like to cap a lot
These—these days, niggas like to cap a lot
These—these days, niggas like to cap a lot

Catch a body join a gang
We still on the same thing, you know
In the name of Gee
Blvd Mel

[Verse 1]
Yeah, king 8
You know I'm passing out the head stones
Don't fuck with mines
And I see red, I leave your head gone
Going murder murder
The only thing they understand
They took my heart, I thought I'd never ever smile again
Until we crash on something, till we flatline one
Yeah, draco twist his body, I still got that gun
Everybody wanna be a op until they see it's real
They don't know somebody bleed every time I drop a tear

[Chorus]
Yeah, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you

[Verse 2]
I'm always with some killers and you niggas know that
So if you got a problem, better hope that
I don't send Yoshi to your doormat
Or have Osama spin a Bin and leave you where you sleeping
If I'm on your fucking mind you better keep it where you thinking
Fuck is you thinking?
The only time I take it off my waist is when I'm squeezing
Bitch, I'm a demon
My nigga banging red, I'm leaving red
You smoking who? You smoking what?
But you gon' die for what you said

[Chorus]
Yeah, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you
Nigga, fuck you, and you, and you

[Verse 3]
2012, I shot a nigga bitch, I been like that
You can't call yourself a op if we ain't shot you yet
Two 40's and a 9 and a drake in the back
And if you wanna join the gang you gotta get you a head
Don't get me pissed off, I'll bring the bitch off
One drink is all it takes to knock the click off
Applying pressure on the field from the kick off
And we gon' spin the bin again if miss off

everything i wanted,Billie Eilish,"

[Verse 1]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'they don't deserve you'""

[Verse 2]
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear 'they don't deserve you'""

[Outro]
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

Walk home with me, for I have news for you
In order to shield her from the evils of this world
I have decided to marry Johanna next Monday

Ah, sir happy news

Strange, when I offered myself to her, she showed a certain reluctance

[BEADLE, sung]
Excuse me my lord
May I request my lord
Permission my lord to speak?

Forgive me if I suggest my lord
You’re looking less than your best my lord
There’s powder upon your vest my lord
And stubble upon your cheek

And ladies my lord
Are weak

[JUDGE, spoken]
Stubble you say?
Perhaps at times I am over hasty with my morning ablutions

[BEADLE, sung]
Fret not though my lord
I know a place my lord
A barber my lord of skill
Thus armed with a shaven face my lord
Some eau de cologne to grace my lord
And musk to enhance the chase my lord
You’ll dazzle the girl until

[MRS. LOVETT]
A customer!

Wait! What's your rush? What's your hurry?
You gave me such a fright, I thought you was a ghost
Half a minute, can't you sit? Sit you down, Sit!
All I meant is that I haven't seen a customer for weeks

Did you come here for a pie, sir?
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague
What was that? But you'd think we had the plague
From the way that people keep avoiding
No, you don't

Heaven knows I try, sir!
But there's no one comes in even to inhale
Right you are, sir, would you like a drop of ale?
Mind you, I can hardly blame them

These are probably the worst pies in London
I know why nobody cares to take them
I should know, I make them, but good? No
The worst pies in London
Even that's polite, the worst pies in London
If you doubt it take a bite

Is that just, disgusting? You have to concede it
It's nothing but crusting, here drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London
And no wonder with the price of meat

What it is when you get it
Never thought I'd live to see the day
Men'd think it was a treat, finding poor animals
What are dying in the street

Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop
Does a business, but I notice something weird
Lately all her neighbors cats have disappeared
Have to hand it to her, what I calls enterprise
Popping pussies into pies

Wouldn't do in my shop
Just the thought of it's enough to make you sick
And I'm telling you them pussycats is quick
No denying times is hard, sir

Even harder than the worst pies in London
Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting? All greasy and gritty?
It looks like it's molting and tastes like...well, pity
A woman alone...with limited wind

And the worst pies in London
Ah, sir, times is hard, times is hard

[Stefy Nrg - It's a Fable]
It's a fable it's a dream
It's a song for you and me
It's a fable it's a dream
We could make it last forever
It's a fable it's a dream
It's a perfect moment to live
It's a fable it's a dream
That could happen just once in a life time

[Baracuda - Where Is The Love]
Where is the love in every fading rainbow
High above trees below the moon and sun
Where is the love in every black-eyed ocean
Where is the love

Where is the love in every left down heartbeat
Glamour and fall is what I'm thinking of
Where is the love how could you say it's over
Where is the love

[Alex C. feat. Yasmin K. - Angel of Darkness]

I hold you tight
Oh baby bounce with me I feel the energy
A magic love so bright is coming over me
Oh baby bounce with me and be my fantasy tonight
I hold you tight oh baby

Bounce with me I feel the energy
A magic love so bright is coming over me
Oh baby bounce with me and be my fantasy tonight
I hold you tight oh baby

[Cascada - Ready For Love]
You got me deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
I'm running around but there's no place to hide
I start to talk in my sleep, our souls have divided
Why can't they forgive me these demons inside
Deeper than deep, I'm constantly flying
My heart starts to shiver for I was letting up
I start to talk in my sleep, cause our souls have divided
How can it be that you're ready for love

Ready for love

[Baracuda - I Will Love Again]
I will love again
Though my heart is breaking
I will love again
Stronger than before

I will love again
Even if it takes a lifetime to get over you
Heaven only knows
Oh-oh

If I'm true to myself
Nobody else can take the place of you
But I've got to move on
Tell me what else can I do

[Cascada - Dangerous]
Give me a break
I'm melting away
You're so dangerous
Or is it too late?
Gotta know what's on your mind
I'm out of control
Cause you want it all
You're so dangerous
My biggest mistake
I'm blinded by your eyes
Dangerous

[Baby Alice - Pina Colada Boy]
Pina colada boy, you make the girls go ahh
And when the sun goes down you make my world spin round
Pina colada boy, you make the girls go ahh
But when the suns back high baby I wave bye bye

[Cascada - Truly Madly Deeply]
I wanna stand with you on a mountain
I wanna bathe with you in the sea

A game for fools

You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime

You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime
You made me discover one of the stars above us

[DJ Allstar feat. Naz - Last Christmas]
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Last Christmas
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover but you tore me apart
Oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

[Bermuda Loverz - My Girl]
Ladeedada
I've been around my girl
I look into her eyes
Ladadeedada
Ladadeedada
It's all about my girl
I look into her eyes
Ladadeedada

[Belle Lawrence - Bad Day]
Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile, and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down, and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day

[Digital Sexy - Til Death]
Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it
Take my life
But I'm cool with it
So hot y'all the music
So loud, I don't know what to do with it

Help my mind
Yeah, I'm losing it

Like dancin' with the devil
I could do this all night
Til death do we party, with the music I die

[Yamboo - Feelings]
Feelings, feelings
Aye-i-aye-i-aye
Come together
Have a happy Christmas tonight
Woa-woa-woa
Feelings, feelings
Show your feelings
Aye-i-aye-i-aye
Come together
Have a happy Christmas tonight
Woa-woa-woa

[DJ Tronix - Be With You]
Take my hand, be lift away
To a place beyond the stars
I close my eyes and take a break
Be forever here my star
I need you here for all my days
Be together [?]
From now on to the end of days

The Ship,Various Artists,"

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you come around

We talk about it all night long
We define our moral ground
But when I crawl into your arms
Everything comes tumbling down

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come around

Your face has fallen sad now
For you know the time is nigh
When I must remove your wings
And you, you must try to fly

Come sail your ships around me
And burn your bridges down
We make a little history baby
Every time you come around
Come loose your dogs upon me
And let your hair hang down
You are a little mystery to me
Every time you come around

Recognize you. You're safe now

[JOHANNA, spoken]
Safe? So we run away and then all our dreams come true?

[ANTHONY, spoken]
I hope so

[JOHANNA, spoken]
I've never had dreams... only nightmares

[ANTHONY, spoken]
Johanna, when we're free of this place all the ghosts will go away

Evil it is, Sir. The stink of evil from below! From her! She's the devil's wife! Beware of her sir. She, with no pity in her heart!

Hey, don't I know you mister?

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
Mr. Todd?
Where is she?

[TODD, spoken]
Below, your honor, with my neighbor. Thank heavens the sailor did not molest her. Thank heavens too, she has seen the error
Of her ways

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
She has?

[TODD, spoken]
Oh, yes, your lesson was well learned. She speaks only of you, longing for forgiveness

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
Then she shall have it!
She'll be here soon, you say?

[TODD, spoken]
Yes!

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
Excellent, my friend!

How 'bout a shave?
Sit, sir, sit!

Oh, pretty women

Pretty women, yes!

Johanna, Johanna

[TODD]
Pretty women, pretty women are a wonder. Pretty women!

[TODD & JUDGE TURPIN]
Pretty women what would we do
For women

[TODD & JUDGE TURPIN]
Blowing out their candles
Or combing out their hair

[JUDGE TURPIN]
Then they leave

[TODD & JUDGE TURPIN]
Even when they even when they
Leave they still leave you and
Are there, there vanish they
There somehow can still
Remain there with
You there

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
How seldom it is one meets a fellow spirit

[TODD, spoken]
With fellow taste... in women at least

[JUDGE TURPIN, spoken]
What's that?

[TODD, spoken]
The years no doubt have changed me, sir, but now I suppose the face of a barber—the face of a prisoner in the dark is not
Particularly memorable

Benjamin Barker!

BENJAMIN BARKER!

Rest now my friend
Rest now forever
Sleep now the untroubled
Sleep of the angels

Poison, she did

Home head all she did for
Months was just lie
Again there in bed. Should
Have been in
Lucy! hospital, wound up
In bedlam instead
Oh my poor thing, better

Wife she was I
What love you. Could that
Thing have cared for
Have I you, like me?
Done?

Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical and yet appropriate as always
As you've said repeatedly there's
Little point in dwelling on the past

Now come here do you mean it?
My love everything I did
Nothing I swear I thought
To fear was only for the
My love best. belive me!
What's dead Can we still be

The Flood,Various Artists,"

[Verse]
Did you read about the flood?
It happened a long time ago
Way in a little country town
Way down in Mississippi
It rained and it rained
It rained both night and day
Listen, people were worried
And, they began to cry:
""Lord have mercy, where can we go now""?
There was women and there was children
Screaming and crying: ""Lord have mercy
In this great disaster
Who can we go to, now, but you Lord?""
In this great flood of Tupelo, Mississippi
It happened one evening, one Friday evening
A long time ago
It rained and it rained
The people of Tupelo was out in the farm
Gathering that harvest
A dark cloud began to rise
Way back on the western horizon
Mmmm-mmmm, wasn't that a mighty time?
Lemme hear you tell ’em about it, Albert:

Reunion,Various Artists,"

CZĘŚĆ I / prod. Michos NCB

[Zwrotka 1: Majty Majk]
Dom z austriackiej cegły, klimat górski mam tu
Od niemieckich sukienników do Ruskich na targu
A dziś: wylew z B-B rapu, style tęgie katuj
Żyję na tym szlaku - Trakt Cesarski, Wiedeń-Kraków
Żaden Śląsk, mamy swój region, śląski w ogóle
Śląsk wpada w weekend na fotkę z Bolkiem, Lolkiem
Luz, nie burz się jak Podzamcze, testuj talent
Wiesz, gdzie my to robimy, robimy to w Bielsku-Białej

[Zwrotka 2: Staf]
Od Tańskiego ulicy, Skrzydlewskiego, Trzech Diamentów
Wiem, co się liczy, do czego brak sentymentów
Od Cieszyńskiej, zawiewa halny z lotniska
Konsumentów z daleka, bliska pozdrawiam, ściskam
Jak z urwiska skok, to lotników dzielnica
Odważnie jak szybowce pod sklepieniem w Aleksandrowicach
Pierwsze loty jak Ikar, tracki od KaWuHa
Wysoka piona GieZet, rap prosto z serducha

[Zwrotka 3: Pueblos]
Moje wersy to dzieci Temidy z Midasem, popatrz
Jak moje osiedle, bo są na wagę złota
Przy blokach ""pozmieniało się dookoła""
Markety zamiast pola i parkingi zamiast boja (skojarz)
Patrzę na to z ósmego piętra wieżowca
A dwa kominy mi zawsze służą tutaj za kompas
Dobra... Znam każdy chodnik
Od regionalnych animozji dostaję białej gorączki

[Zwrotka 4: Wicher]
Osiedle na wagę złota, nie zamierzam ważyć słów, błagam
Łany Złote pod mą batutą jak Sztaba
Widziałem wiele w tym mieście, mimo, że młody rocznik
Tych akcji bym nie sprzedał za hajs, bo to nie Wall Street
Budujemy tu imperium, talentów kopalnię
A 3/4 już dawno nie jest undergroundem
Mamy różne zdania, łączy jedno miejsce
Bo nigdy nie mówię szeptem, kiedy mówię skąd jestem

[Skrecze: DJ Son]

[Zwrotka 5: Sonar NCB]
Rejonu reprezentant, jak i NCB ekipy
Bit pokrywam jak impregnat, za koncerty zbieram kwity
To Bielsko Południe, Batorego moim domem
Maluję jak na płótnie, pędzel stał się mikrofonem
Tu gdzie dojrzewamy, wszystkim teren dobrze znany
Dawno nie ma marry rany, wokół widać spore zmiany
Wszystko, co potrzebne, park i stadion starym squatem
Kiedyś miejsce niebezpieczne, dziś nie spotkasz się z kłopotem

[Zwrotka 6: Lu zDP]
Ziomki powtarzają wciąż ""Puszczaj słowa w rejon
Jak przystało na rapera z ulicy Słowackiego""
Miasto, miasto moje a w nim
Jestem zajęty tym, by sobą być #Theodor_Sixt
Na wersach z klasą, a dziedzicznie luz w kości
Stoję na wzgórzu jak rezydencja - Zamek Sułkowskich
Na dzielni od lat za szacun śmigam
Najlepsze kasztany są na Placu Pigal

[Zwrotka 7: Igrekzet]
Wszędzie dobrze, ale najlepiej w Komo
Od Sosny po Małpi Gaj hi-fi stereo płoną
Znów odpalam metronom u Kromparku w noc
I szyję wersy, a wersy przeszywają na wskroś
K do O do M do O, O do R do O do W
W do I do C do E kręcą fortuny kołem tu
I pokale wszystkie w górę za nasze strony
Stolicę małego Fiata i Krajowej gorzoły
Igrekzet

CZĘŚĆ II / prod. Señor Fresh

[Zwrotka 8: Adecki zDP]
Dziesięć wiosen przed Grunwaldem mi zniszczyli dzielnię
615 lat później jeden emce to ją spalił dźwiękiem
Kopyt koni tętent, toczę fele tu #Ben_Hur
Robię tą flotę bo mogę, tego nie nauczysz się ze szkolnych lektur
Adecki zDP, na starobielskich bunkrach pan
1 9 3 9 - bieda, łatwo skóry nie dam - przebacz #Święty_Stanisław
Będę stał tu jak najstarszy kościół
Witam jegomościów- pierwsza dzielnica
Dwunasty wiek - czas założenia
Święty Olimp, czytaj - one love Strażnica

[Zwrotka 9: Młody MD]
Kto trzyma tu chorągiew? Wojsko polskie
Krwawy sorbet, przejdziem frontem
Dzieci rewolucji non stop na bombie
Znaki destrukcji #Jerzy_Orwell
Wielki comeback, znasz mnie z ksywki
Piwnice, wieżowce jak pierwszy milion
Znaki na murach to znaki charyzmy
Szkoła i boisko, tu rodził się hip-hop
Gdzie pierwsze nawijki, niektórzy odpadli
Żołnierze bez imion są tu pochowani
Stawali do walki z góry przegrani
Wkurwienie i strach, biedne kochanki
Nie musisz sie uczyć znaków grażdanki
Nie wiszą w powietrzu niemieckie umlauty
Walczyli o kraj I. Armii
Dumny jak paw, z osiedla i z nazwy

[Zwrotka 10: Uszer zDP]
XV wiek, Podnóża wzgórza powstaje dzielnia, gdzie płynie Niper
Franz Josef Strasse, Kaiserhof Korna, nie Kapitan Kliper
Linia: Bielitz-Vienna cug, Willa Sixta, pierwszy tramwaj
Plac Chrobrego głównym tu, stilo Austro-Węgry #Patria
Eklektyzm Emila dźwiega teatr, taniec nimf #Talia
Poczta Polska i podzamcze, pogrzebana stoisk magia
Miłość do przedmieścia ziemi (zDP), przy tym siada geofagia
Wiem, że tego nic nie zmieni, Mały Wiedeń, serce miasta

[Zwrotka 11: Cooks]
W sumie życie tu mija nam no-stress, każdy zna i pamięta dobrze
Boisko szkolne, w tym miejscu wylany montaną [talerzyk?], proste
Stale zmieniają horyzont, by żyło się lepiej tu w Bielsku, a jak
Beskidzkie odłamy alejek zimnego betonu, to ja dobrze znam
Widok bezcenny, osiedlowy miraż jest piękny
Osiedle na bagnach, historia oparta słowami poprzednich
3/4 Underground bije z tego miejsca, nie ma przejścia
Jedna dzielnia tu gdzie żyjemy, serce pamięta

[Zwrotka 12: Diament]
Patrzę na świat z domu 2 piętra, drogą do Bielska
Tusz na rękach dla Was, bo chcę pokazać, że to nieważne gdzie mieszkasz
Nic o nas bez nas, trzymamy się blisko jak granica czeska
Wyżej od innych, ziemia szlachecka
Gdzie diamenty z podwórek depczą po piętach Wam
Mandaty na skwerkach? Ta sekta jest wielka
Na życie studenta tu nie ma zaklęcia
Bo wygląda ono jak strefa zamknięta
Ale miasto w sercach, do twarzy B-B wpisane jak make-up
Od bajek reksia po handlowe centra
I rapu z południa a to moja wersja

[Zwrotka 13: JHN]
Z kalki struktura, ta architektura i mentalnie, bo nie tylko wizualnie
Się każdy tu tuła bez reakcji na prawdę
Tektura, która widzi wszystko linearnie
By ominąć załamkę i życie w bólach
Na murach kładą farbę administracje
Zabieg zwany antydepresantem
Te klatki to dziura i kumasz to, jak kminisz akcje
Zaprawdę powiadam, naprawdę
Osiedle widziałeś? To jakbyś widział każde
Ale nie wszędzie tak tętni talentem
Piona z Bielska-Białej, jeszcze namieszamy w rapgrze
Under wnosi tu charakter, zostawi porażenie to rażenie, daj skafander
Tu wrażenie masz, że płynę jak meander
Pierwszym obiegiem, na scenie, BBa, masz awangardę
Z fartem

""Południowe Gigant"" - bardziej PKM niż MZK
Kiedy na ustawkę śmigam - ważne być, nieważne jak
Znam trasę bardzo dobrze, więc świadomie mogę kimać
Ale porzucam ten pomysł jakoś zwykle przy kominach
Tryt, tryt telefon! Trzeba tu zaraz dać koda ziomom
Że mogą się zbierać już, bo mijam kościół w Komo
Objeżdżam Fiata, widzę z lewej gdzieś z betonu słonia
Przetarta przez lata trasa wiedzie mnie pod ekonoma

[Skrecze: DJ Kaz]

[Zwrotka 15: Michos NCB]
Jestem z miejsca, gdzie wszystko widać z innej perspektywy
Kolejka zabierze Ciebie tu na top, byś zwolnił tryby
1026 metrów, to da Ci tu pełne spektrum
Ty popatrz w dół, Bielsko-Biała jest jak z Legolandu
Stara Brygadzistów, nowa AK
W sercu mnóstwo sentymentu zawsze, kiedy tu wracam
Tu powstała historia, która będzie nieśmiertelna
Od 5MA mam przez SOS po NCB, Szyndzielnia

[Skrecze: DJ Ure]

[Zwrotka 16: Głuchy NCB]
Witaj na szczycie, to Mekka Bielska, poziom rapy, dobre mordy
Pozor, ziomek, robim konkret, pozer, co jest? Pakuj torby
To moje miejsce, bracie, mega Tobie niewygodna prawda
Ikar, spłoniesz, no bo to słońce, szyndzielniowy rejon, AK
Zapraszam, napawa to duma, nosimy to w sercach
Kuma to grupa, Ty czujesz majestat, suma to lata NCB, SOS, AK
Mamy tu kamikadze, w rapie przecieramy szlaki
No bo ten wątek, kąty nasze, wychwalamy aż po Bałtyk

Flying On My Own,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
There's something shifting in the air
If I'm not mistaken
The dust is clearing everywhere
Memories awaken

[Pre-Chorus]
My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I'm finding my way

[Chorus]
I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love

On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)

[Verse 2]
The warmer winds will carry me
Anywhere I want them to
If you could see what I can see
That nothing's blockin' my view

[Pre-Chorus]
I look to the sky now
It's a beautiful day

[Chorus]
I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own
On the wings of your love
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)

[Bridge]
I'm free like an eagle, soar like an eagle
Sailing the winds of change
On the winds of change
On the winds of change

My feet on the runway
It's a beautiful day
I look to the sky now
I'm finding my way

[Chorus]
I'm flying on my own (On the wings of your love)

Lovers Never Die,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
You said forever after
But what came after that
Wasn't what I expected
I expected you back
You said that you’re romantic
Where's the romance in this?
It's obvious that you’re full of it

[Verse 2]
I tried to give it time
But then our time slipped away
You said that you'd be fine
But finally I'm awake
You said it's only habit
But what happened is this
It's obvious I'm not having it

[Pre-Chorus]
You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lines

[Chorus]
If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

[Verse 3]
I trust too easily
I trusted you'd treat me well
I’ve faced the truth
But facing you, I’m asking for help
You played the gentleman
But there's no gentle in this
It’s obvious you're full of it

[Pre-Chorus]
You said the pretty things you know I like
But I can read between the lies

[Chorus]
If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?

[Bridge]
It was just a lie
But I survived
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?
Oo-oo, oh-oh

[Outro]
If lovers never die then why do I need you?
Believe when I see you
Whenever I see you
It kills me inside
Why'd you say goodbye if lovers never die?
Why do you say goodbye if lovers never die?
(No)

Falling In Love Again,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
When the sun went down on that day
I never thought that love would come back to me
When I closed my eyes and tried to dream
Darkness was the only thing I could see

[Pre-Chorus]
I had run out of hope
Reached the end of the road
Hit the rocks at the bottom with no farther to go
But just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

[Chorus]
I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again
I can't believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love once again

[Verse 2]
When you take my hand you hold my heart
And I know everything will be alright
When you touch me there I feel it everywhere
I'm loving things I never thought I would like

[Chorus]
I can't believe I'm falling in love once again
I can’t believe I’m falling in love, but I am
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can’t believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again, oh whoa

[Bridge]
Just when I thought I was destined to end up all alone
You showed me there's more to this life

[Chorus; Céline Dion & Skylar Grey]
I can’t believe I'm falling in love once again (Oh, I'm falling in love once again)
(I can't believe I'm falling in love, but I am)
I never thought that I would be strong enough to move on
No, this wasn't part of the plan
I can't believe I'm falling in love
But I'm falling in love
Once again

[Outro]
Oh-oh-ooh
Once again
Mm-mmm

Lying Down,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
Oh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I've no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left

[Pre-Chorus]
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

[Chorus]
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I've just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust

[Chorus]
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Refrain]
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

[Chorus]
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won’t take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down

[Refrain]
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down

Courage,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
I would be lying if I said I'm fine
I think of you at least a hundred times
'Cause in the echo of my voice I hear your words
Just like you're there
I still come home from a long day
So much to talk about, so much to say
I love to think that we're still making plans
In conversations that'll never end
In conversations that'll never end

[Chorus]
Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

[Verse 2]
Not one to hide from the truth, I know
It's outta my hands but I won't let you go
There's no replacing the way you touched me
I still feel the rush
Sometimes it drowns me 'til I can't breathe
Thinking it's only in our memories
But then I talk to you like I did then
In conversations that will never end

[Chorus]
Courage, don't you dare fail me now
I need you to keep away the doubts
I'm staring in the face of something new
You're all I got to hold on to
So, courage, don't you dare fail me now

[Bridge]
'Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
This world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash yet
Long as your echo never fades out

[Chorus]
Courage, don't you dare fail me now
'Cause it's not easy when you're not with me
This world of madness goes faster now
And it's a train wreck, but I won't crash yet
Long as your echo never fades out
Courage, don't you dare fail me now

Imperfections,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
I try to give all of myself to you
But before I can get there
Got parts of me I'm trying to lose

[Refrain]
Yeah, I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixin' mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So, give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you
Give it up, give it up now
Give it up, give it up
I ain't gonna save you, no
Give it up, give it up
Now

[Chorus]
'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah, I got my own

Hold on, not tryna put you on the shelf
But, before I can love you
I need to learn to love myself

'Cause, I got my own imperfections
I got my own set of scars to hide
I got my own imperfections
I can't hold your heart when I'm fixin' mine

'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah, I got my own
I got my own

[Bridge]
They're part of me and you are too
And I don't really wanna choose
Can you love them the way that I love you?
They made me who I am today
And they won't ever go away
Can you love them the way that I love you?

[Chorus]
'Cause I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
I got my own imperfections
Yeah, I got my own
I got my own
(But I got)

[Outro]
Before I can love you (Before I can love you)
I need to learn to love myself (I got my own imperfections)
Before I can trust you (Before I can trust you)
I need to learn to trust myself
(I need to, I need to)
(Before I can love you)
(I got my)

Change My Mind,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be
Effortless dancing with symmetry
And the memory's more or less killing me

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Don't fight it

[Chorus]
Change my mind
Make me drunk on you again
Turn back time
Don’t you wonder where I’ve been?

[Refrain]
Are you ever gonna change my mind? (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)
I've been waiting for you, change my mind (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)

Chant my name, chant the words to my dying day
But I just seem to keep pushing you away
And it’s all I can do as an optimist
To look out on the shore for our lonely ship

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my sirens
Running to your fire
Can't fight it

[Chorus]
Change my mind
Make me drunk on you again
Take back time
Don’t you wonder where I’ve been?

Are you ever gonna change my mind? (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you?)
I've been waiting for you, change my mind (Are you ever?)
Change my mind (Are you ever?)

We were bold, we were dust, we were energy
We were more in the light than we'd ever be

Say Yes,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
You push your love away
When it throws you a rope
You keep turning the pages
'Cause you're losing hope

[Pre-Chorus]
You always put a cap on your fire
You think that everyone is a liar
You gotta let that thinking go
Stop saying, ""No, no, no""

[Chorus]
Say ""Yes"" once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say ""Yes"" once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Remember the good times
Let go of the pain
Say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
When he wants to talk
You got nothing to say
When he turns and smiles at you
You turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
You always put a cap on your fire
Always holding back your desire
You gotta let your feelings show
Stop saying, ""No, no, no""

[Chorus]
Say ""Yes"" once more
You deserve to feel that rush again
Say ""Yes"" once more
Let it touch you like it did back then
Oh, remember the good times
Let go of the pain

With everything politically correct
Just wanna lock myself away, leave me alone
Gonna lay it all out on my hairbrush microphone

I wanna sit like nobody's listening
I wanna talk like nobody cares
I wanna party like a believer

This is from the heart
Ready to let my guard down whatever the cost
Keepin' it safe, you just can't love outside the box
So I'm gonna try my luck on you

[Verse 2]
This is from a girl
Who still believed that there was someone in the world
To take her at her best and her worst
Won't give up when it hurts
So I'm gonna try my luck
I'm gonna try my luck, baby
I'm gonna try my luck on you

Always walking the beat of their own drum
Ain't afraid to take it as it comes
Yeah, you wanna try your luck
Did you wanna try your luck on me?

For The Lover That I Lost,Céline Dion,"

Think about your lips and the way they kiss
There's so much I really miss about you
Sittin' on the beach, you were still in reach
And I haven't felt free without you

[Pre-Chorus]
All of the memories feel like magic
All of the fighting seems so sweet
All that we were, my love, is tragic
And you're the last thing that I need

So I lay a dozen roses
For the lover that I lost
I stand by all my choices
Even though I pay the cost
Oh, all those nights, the lows and highs
I share them all with you
So I lay a dozen roses
I lay them there, I lay them there for you

I don't want to wait too long
Wait too long, so what do I do?
I don't want to take this time
To look inside, it hurts when I do

I Will Be Stronger,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
You were always stronger than me
The first in the deep end but then the first to leave
And I have missed you so heavily
But the weight's kind of lifting, I'm seeing colors in the street
And though I might have been lonely or lost
I don't feel like giving up just because you climbed off

[Chorus]
And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up a road is not the end

[Verse 2]
Was just a moment, no souvenirs
No ink in my shoulder, but, honey, you were here
And I know love wins over pride
I won't outstay my welcome, but love is on my side

[Chorus]
And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up this road, it's not the end

[Bridge]
And I know we said forever
And I know you left your mark
But you gave me a life worth living

[Chorus]
And tonight I have all I need
I got forgiveness, I'm feeling different
Tonight I will be stronger
I didn't ask to be set free
But in my hour of weakness, I found a sweetness
'Cause sometimes love must die to be born again
One step up this road, it's not the end

[Outro]
It's not the end
It's not the end

How Did You Get Here,Céline Dion,"

[Intro]
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I've been thinking about you
More than I want to
Spinning me around in this web
Getting in my heart and my head
Hanging on every word
Pretending they go unheard
Wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time I hear you speak

[Pre-Chorus]
But you do
Yes, you do

[Chorus]
I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you? How did you?)
Tell me, who let you in? Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you? How did you?)

[Verse 2]
Can't fight this feeling
My heart's too revealing
Even though it's making me a fool
Can't tell love when to strike, who to choose
You're the one pulling me close
You're the one that I need the most
I wish you didn't make me so weak
Every time you're next to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But you do
Yes, you do

[Chorus]
I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you? How did you?)
Tell me, who let you in? Shook all my confidence
How did you get here? (How did you? How did you?)
Woah
Woah, how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here? How did you get here?
How did you scale the walls to my heart?
How did you know where to start?
How did you get here? How did you, how did you?

I wasn't looking for love, I was comfortable
How did you get here? (How did you get here?)
Tell me, who let you in? Shook all my confidence

Woah, how did you get here?
How did you? How did you?

Look at Us Now,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
Hard to look at pictures on the wall
Hard to pick the phone up when you call
Hardly talking anymore 'cause a single word could start a war
Once upon a time we had it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would’ve known the future wasn't for us?
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lead on love
But look at us now
Look at us now

[Chorus]
How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart?
Can’t put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark?
You know it's killing me to say it out loud
Oh, look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

[Verse 2]
Back to back, we sleep on separate sides
Back and forth, we slowly lose our minds
Backing out the driveway feels like this goodbye could be for real
Oh, once upon a time time was on our side

[Pre-Chorus]
Who would've known the future wasn't for us?
Fools, we got it wrong, so wrong

[Chorus]
How can we hold it together
When we're falling apart?
Can't put my finger on the when, the why, the how
How can we see to forever
When we're lost in the dark?
You know it’s killing me to say it out loud
Oh, look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground
And you can’t even look at me now
Oh baby, look at us now

[Outro]
Who would've known the future wasn’t for us?
Fools, we got it wrong
Thinking that we lead on love
But look at us now
Two broken hearts on the ground

Perfect Goodbye,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
Forty five steps in the same direction
Oh, ain't it strange we're here connecting?
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
No regrets, this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

[Chorus]
Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

[Verse 2]
Forty five steps in the same direction
Just take my hand, don't ask no questions
Don't need to understand if God's got a plan
It's out of our hands anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
No regrets, this is heaven sent
Look at where we are, it's amazing
And if you need me, I will be in your memory

[Chorus]
Goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't wanna be here without you
I'd rather just bottle time
Open up the memory and keep you by my side
I can't believe that I ever found you
Baby, take a look around
Everything is perfect now

[Chorus]
So goodnight baby, kiss me now, don't make me sad
After midnight promise we'll never look back
This shit is perfect, each second worth it
Let's save this love before we go and hurt it now
Goodnight baby, with stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye
With stars in the sky
This is the perfect goodbye
This is the perfect goodbye

Best of All,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
Sun going down
Leaving pearls on the skyline
Did you just do what you did?
Feel like I can feel for the first time
Every tiny light in your eyes
Every flicker, every thought going by

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it madness?
Is it the worst kind of madness?

[Chorus]
No, it's the best of all
Nobody looked at me like that before
Nobody's ever fallen when I fall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?
Oh no
It's the best of all

[Verse 2]
All of my life
I've been blown by the wind
In and out of lonely places, washed up everywhere
But now I know where I'm going

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it madness?
Is it the worst kind of madness?

[Chorus]
No, it's the best of all
Nobody looked at me like that before
Nobody's ever fallen when I fall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?

[Outro]
No, it's the best of all
It's not just my heart, you have my whole damn world
You wanna know, you wanna know what I'm feeling
Ten feet tall
On my knees in the streetlight at your door
Is it wrong to be sure?
Oh no
It's the best of all

Heart of Glass,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
Couldn't breathe, couldn't breathe
It was high tide
Couldn't leave, couldn't leave
Felt the night sky closing in
Closing in on me
Couldn't scream, couldn't dream
Only nightmares pity me
Couldn't sleep for the darkness closing in
Closing in on me

[Pre-Chorus]
See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said, ""See a need, filll the need""
You said, ""See a need""

Until now
I was living in a heart of glass
I was living in a heart of glass
I've been living in a heart of glass

Keep me safe in your loving embracing arms
Kiss your face 'til there's no more to say
I'll hold you near
I'll hold you near to me

See a need, fill the need
See a need, fill the need
You said, ""See a need, fill the need""
You said, ""See a need""

Boundaries,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
We are the ones that walk to fire
And people say, ""Don't touch,"" yeah, people say, ""Don't touch""
We are the ones that never listen
We can't get burned enough, we can’t get burned enough

[Chorus]
And there's no boundaries
Can ever hurt you, you can never hurt me
And we're so unique for falling in love and letting love be

[Verse 2]
You've got to take me to that place
You let your guard down, yeah, you let your guard down, yeah
If you don't take me all the way
We'll let the world down, no, can't let the world down, no

[Chorus]
And there's no boundaries
That can ever hurt you (Now you've found me)
You can never hurt me (There's no boundaries)
And we're so unique for falling in love (Now you've found me)

The Hard Way,Céline Dion,"

[Verse 1]
I been, I been, I been
I been touching fires for the sake of feelin'
I been chasing,  chasing
Chasing all these highs so I could crash the ceiling
I been restless, tempted to follow every devil way down
I took it so low and at the time, it looked like no way out

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain't how it's ending
Said to myself, said to myself
""This ain't how I'm gonna go down""

[Chorus]
When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way, hard way

[Verse 2]
Turnin', turnin', turnin'
Turnin' every corner 'cause my heart was yearning
For something more than 4 AM
Messed up in bed, no, I don't miss that feeling
I don't see a reason
Chasing love down a dead end
But see the truth is
I wouldn't know that unless I did

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to see
Try to believe
I write my story and this ain't how it's ending
Said to myself, said to myself
""This ain't how I'm gonna go down""

[Chorus]
When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way

[Bridge]
I wouldn't know what I'm made of
If I took the easy way out (I took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here
The hard times were worth what I found (I found)
I wouldn't know what I'm made of (I wouldn't know)
If I took the easy way out (I took the easy way out)
As long as it took me to get here  (To get here)
The hard times were worth what I found

[Chorus]
When the bottom hit my soul
I had to climb up all alone
When the night shut down my hope
I had to find a light to hold
You gotta break just a little, die just a little
To come alive in the right way
And sometimes to get home you gotta go
The hard way

What If I Never Get Over You,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1: Charles Kelly]
It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott]
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

[Verse 2: Hillary Scott & Charles Kelly]
Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott]
What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

[Bridge: Charles Kelly, Hillary Scott & Both]
Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?

[Chorus: Charles Kelly & Hillary Scott, Hillary Scott & Charles Kelly]
I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over
What if I never get over you?

[Outro: Hillary Scott, Charles Kelly & Both]
What if I never get over you?
Oh, what if I never get over?
Over you

Pictures,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
There's a four-by-six of a sunset kiss
And one of you laughin' at me catching my first fish
One on Valentine's Day
With the mariachi band at our favorite place

[Chorus]
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happenin'
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

[Verse 2]
There's one on my phone that I can't erase (One on my phone)
But you'd never know by the smile on my face
That inside I was dying, later that night I'd be crying
The last one before ""Goodbye""

[Chorus]
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

[Bridge]
No photo evidence, not a single proof
Of all the hell that we went through

[Chorus]
But damn, we sure looked happy in pictures
The camera doesn't show the way it hurt
No, that ain't the way I remember it happening
In between the flashes it was sad, it was tragic
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures

(So happy in pictures), oh, yes we did
Yeah, we sure looked happy in pictures (So happy)

Crazy Love,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I was lost
Like a broken whisky bottle in an alley
You should've, but you wouldn't leave without me
You took me home

[Verse 2]
We were wild ones
Burning like that backseat back in '08
And everybody said they wouldn't do it
But they were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You
You were reckless on that day you took my hand
But you, you could see right through the boy and see a man
And here I stand

[Chorus]
Thank God for you
Thank God for us
Thank God for crazy love

[Verse 3]
Ain't it funny
How a couple silly kids could see forever?
And looking back, we shouldn't be together
But here we are

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, you
You were reckless on that day you took my hand
And you, you could see right through the boy and see a man
And here I stand

You Can Do You,Lady Antebellum,"

Yeah

Suits and boots and backs will rest
Start filling up the room
Friday night, fresh paychecks
All looking for something to do
Old school Diamond Rio
Ringing out from the band
Regulars and out-of-towners
All yellin', ""That's my jam!""
You can go hard or take it slow
Whatever floats your boat, so

[Pre-Chorus]
Go ahead and dance if you want to
Order up another round
We all got something that we're going through
But we ain't gotta worry 'bout it now
Whoa, and it don't matter where you come from
Which side of the county line
We're all here searching for a good time

[Chorus]
You can do you, I'ma do me
We all came here for the same thing
We're all living in the land of the free
So you can do you and I'ma do me
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Life of the party or a wild flower
As long as you're having fun
Straight on the rocks or a whiskey sour
Or anything under the sun
Different strokes for different folks
We can all agree
No matter where you've been, every now and then
We could all use a drink

[Pre-Chorus]
So go ahead and dance if you want to
Order up another round
We all got something that we're going through
But we ain't gotta worry 'bout it now
Whoa, and it don't matter where you come from
Which side of the county line
We're all here searching for a good time

We're all living in the land of the free
So you can do you and I'ma do me

If it makes ya happy
And if it makes you smile
Let's get a little wild

We ain't always gotta agree
'Cause we're all living in the land of the free

You can go home or stay all night
You can go up or you can go down
Find someone and spin them around, and around, and around
Around, and around, and around, and around, baby

What I’m Leaving For,Lady Antebellum,"

Keep those lights on
Toys on the front lawn
Disney World trip next summer
Used kit for our little air-drummer
Food on the table
Brand new cradle
For the angel that's coming in a minute
This house and everybody in it

Got my bags packed, got my ticket
Got a heartache to go with it
Baby, kiss me, say you'll miss me
Oh, while we still got time

[Chorus]
Take a look at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish
Ain't nothing out there like this
And it kills me that I gotta go
Couldn't do it if I didn't know
That every time I'm walking out that door
You know what I'm leaving for

[Verse 2]
When I'm out there
I know I'm where
I'm meant to be picking them strings
And getting that small town to sing
On that last turn home
I can hardly wait
To drop my bags, kiss your face
'Cause all I can do is stop and

Take a look at our little paradise
It ain't much but baby, you and I
Picked the right stars, made the right wish

You know what I'm leaving for

My tank is pushin' empty, I'm runnin' low on caffeine
I guess my good day went to someone else

Just when I'm on the edge of cryin', babe
You're callin' to remind me, remind me

No lie, no lie, no lie, yeah

Roll my windows down, turn that song up loud
Laugh it off and give myself a break
Gray skies try their best to cover up
My sunshine, but not today, not today

Let it be love
Let it be love

I put myself a little higher than I should be
Forget I'm just one drop in a big ol' sea
A little more you, a little less me

The love lifts you up
I know it's hard sometimes to see it, but it does

Let it be love (Let it be love)

[Verse 4]
When you're tired of the mistakes that you keep making
When you feel your heart is done with all its breaking
And all the second chances you keep taking
Let it be love, it's always enough (It's always enough)

[Outro]
'Cause love lifts you up
I know it's hard sometimes to see it, but it does
Oh, it's a power that will rise up, a well that never dries up
The one and only feeling you can trust
Let it be first (Let it be first), let it be us
Oh-oh, let it be love
'Cause it's always enough
Let it be love
Let it be love (Let it be love)
Let it be love

On A Night Like This,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
On a night like this
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you
In this dark so dense
We talk so soft
The way young lovers do

[Pre-Chorus]
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves

[Chorus]
I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the cutest kiss

[Verse 2]
On a night like this
The moon sits still
And the stars are watching too
The way you move is a lullaby
And I could fall (I could fall) in love with you

[Pre-Chorus]
The days last sight turns to cool nights breeze
And this love hangs thick like these willow leaves

[Chorus]
I've hid myself away from this
But your silhouette is the cutest kiss

[Instrumental Interlude]
Oh, oh-oh
Hmm

[Outro]
On a night like this
I could fall in love
I could fall in love with you

Boots,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
Have some scratches and some holes from rusty nails
Have some dirt and dust from all those broken trails
But you shine 'em up brand new
Girl, like only you could do
Somehow you put this runaway train back on the rails

[Chorus]
Yeah, these boots, never walkin' out on you
They ain't got no more running left to do
Whoa, here I am
Whoa, forever your man
These boots, never walkin', walkin' out on you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
It's a miracle they found their way to your door
It's like they forgot all the places they been before, oh
Took a while to find their place
Girl, you know they're here to stay

[Chorus]
Yeah, these boots, never walkin' out on you
They ain't got no more running left to do
Whoa, here I am
Whoa, forever your man
Girl, these boots, never walkin', walkin' out on you, oh

[Bridge]
These boots are never walkin' (No, not this time)
These boots are never walkin' (No, not this time)
These boots are never walkin' out on you

[Chorus]
Oh, these boots, never walkin' out on you
Girl, they ain't got no more running left to do
Whoa, here I am
Whoa, forever your man
Girl, these boots, never walkin', walkin' out on you

Oh, never walkin', baby

The Thing That Wrecks You,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1: Lady Antebellum]
You're a passing car on a one way street
Heading straight through the red lights where the midnight and heartbreak meet
You're a bird in flight to a house in flames
Yeah, you've played every card, but you know it's a losing game

[Chorus: Lady Antebellum]
Yeah, you're running down a darkened road
Where even angels might not go
Some stars have a long glow
Let it pull you like a song you know
It might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you

[Verse 2: Lady Antebellum & Little Big Town]
If I could change, I'd be good for you
Oh, I hate all the madness and pain that I've put you through
It's not your fault (It's not your fault), it's just how I am (It's just how I am)
You're a deer in the headlights and I'm driving as fast as I can (As fast as I can)

[Chorus]
Oh, you're running down a darkened road
Where even angels might not go
And your star's got a lonely glow
And I pull you like a song you know
We might look like a dream come true
But it only leads you straight into
The thing that wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you

[Bridge]
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Ooh)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
You're a passing car on a one way street
(The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, that wrecks you)
(The thing that wrecks you, that wrecks you)

[Outro]
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Oh, the thing that wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (Wrecks you)
The thing that wrecks you, wrecks you (The thing that wrecks you)

Mansion,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
I like nice things
I like diamond rings
I like Malibu beach sights
Sleeping by your side, California king
I like it downtown, valet
Dressed up out there in the city
No, I ain't got nothing against things that are pretty

[Chorus]
Oh, I don’t need a mansion
Sitting high up on a hill
No, I don't need a man that
Shows his love with dollar bills
Don't need a fancy fast car to come and pick up my heart
And ride off into the blue
No, I don’t need a mansion
Baby, I just need you
I just need you
I just need you

[Verse 2]
I want your love
Just the way it is
You ain't gotta dress it up like Hollywood love
'Cause we already rich
I'm talking no frills, stripped down, real deal
The kind that you can't fake it
Yeah, you can wine and dine me all night
But, baby, I'm just saying

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't need a mansion
Sitting high up on a hill
No, I don't need a man that
Shows his love with dollar bills
Don’t need a fancy fast car to come and pick up my heart
And ride off into the blue
No, I don’t need a mansion
Baby, I just need you
I just need you
I just need you

[Bridge]
Come on and hold me tight
Give me your affection, your attention
I want you to know tonight
As long as I got you there's nothing missing

[Outro]
No, I don’t need a mansion
Sitting high up on a hill
No, I don't need a man that
Shows his love with dollar bills
Don't need a fancy fast car to come and pick up my heart
And ride off into the blue
No, I don't need a mansion
Baby, I just need you, whoa (Whoa)
I just need you
Baby, I just need you

Ocean,Lady Antebellum,"

[Verse 1]
How can someone stand so damn close
And feel like they're worlds away?
I can see your sad story eyes
So how do you have no words to say?
All I want is to fall in deeper
Than I've ever been
Why won't you let me?
I can handle your heart, so help me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Verse 2]
Like a lighthouse I've been shinin' bright
Through the dark for the both of us
And ""I've done it outta love"" is not enough
But God, how I wish it was
And I don't wanna find out
How much lonely I can take before you lose me
Baby, look at me and swear you won't lose me

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

[Bridge]
I can't let it go
From moments in your arms
But they come back again
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves
The waves, the waves, the waves, the waves

[Chorus]
Here you are, next to me
So much beauty at my feet
All I wanna do is swim
But the waves keep crashin' in
No, I'm not afraid to drown
Take me out, take me down
I'm so tired of the shore
Let me in, baby
You're an ocean beautiful and blue
I wanna swim in you

Keep My Coo,Lil Peep,"

[Intro]
B-B-Big Los on the track, boy

[Chorus]
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She cannot keep your cool, and you let her (And you let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

[Post-Chorus]
I could, I could, I could, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool (Like a fool)
Eatin' lemon pepper with a leopard, playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Just straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I cannot get enough
So I’m strictly smokin' wax , 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gang, I need me a sad bitch
My life ain't lavish, I ain't never had shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you have it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my throne laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

[Chorus]
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never (Like you never)
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can't keep your cool, and you let her (And you let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper (Lemon pepper)

[Post-Chorus]
I could, I could, I could, I could

[Verse 2]
She said, ""Why you got so many tattoos?""
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, ""Why you always wear them black boots?""
'Cause the blood don't show, hoe
I cannot, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can do, for the public
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money people be makin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is mistaken
Was that money for the takin'? 'Cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then? Spend your life in the pen'?
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man? (Damn)

[Chorus]
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard (Kiki Shepard)
I ain't gon' like you never, I said
I could keep my cool under pressure (Under pressure)
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort (Twice the effort)
She can't keep your cool, and you let her (Let her)
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper

[Outro]
Lemon Pepper
Twice the effort, under pressure
Twice the effort, under pressure

Lover (Remix) [feat. Shawn Mendes],Taylor Swift,"

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: Shawn Mendes with Taylor Swift]
We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty
See, I finally got you now, honey, I won't let you fall

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Shawn Mendes & Both]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Shawn Mendes, Shawn Mendes & Taylor Swift]
Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

[Intro: Coolio]
Greeting, earthlings
We have now taken over your radio

[Chorus: Method Man]
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Going straight to the
Hole, you ain't got no game
I'm breaking ya out the frame, coming through like a train
Looking to take over the whole world is my goal
With my unstoppable crew taking all control
You can't get none of this, we're running this
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunning this
Get out the lane, I'm coming through and if you don't
Wanna move then I'm coming right through you

[Verse 2: Coolio]
It's like inch by inch and step by step
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck
It's like switch when I bust, now your whole crew is dust
Coming through my area, I'mma have to bury ya
The real scream team on your scream scene
It's like showdown on the range go tell me who wanna tangle with the
Ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero?

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real & Method Man]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

[Verse 3: Method Man]
Insane like a runaway train, I'm in your lane
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain
Untamed—ah—, you won't like it when I change
And you are type strange megalomaniacal
Monster in the game and I got my eye on you
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep coming
Down like rain, you feeling me, I'm feeling you
The Monstar again, I'm telling you. Pass me the
Rock, now I'm headed to the basket, get up out my
Way is what you better do, my tactics is unsports-
-Manlike conduct, you better ask it. Don't get
No better than this, you catch my drift? (drift?) You get stripped by
Ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer (whoa), danger
You're dealing with official hoop-bangers with hang time
Like a coat hanger, jump with thunderous
360-degree type dunks
What up doc? The Monstar funk (funk)

[Verse 4: LL Cool J]
Uh, lightning strikes and the court lights get dim
Supreme competition is about to begin
Above the rim, finessing and moves is animated (uh)
Once I get to balling, I can't be deflated (nah)
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is getting money (money, money)
When clicks get to bugging, I'm snatching up their bunnies
Uh, every step I take shakes the ground
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down
This is my planet, I'm 'bout business
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness, uh? (no doubt, uh)
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above
You in it for the money, or in it for the love, M.J.?
23 ways to make a pay
Lounging in the mothership back around my way, uh (uh)
I'm 28 light years old
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole
Am I getting lyrical? Daddy, I think so
Monstar dropping flavor fluid so drink slow

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (yeah, run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore (ah, hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war, turn the music up, please!)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (ah, yah, before)

[Chorus: Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (we hit 'em high, high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (you hit 'em low, low)

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, God bless, pick up your chest (uh, uh)
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test
We're speed balling on the fast break just like the pony express (ooh-uh)
I'm gon' mingle in your face and take the lid off
Just use your head and forfeit the game, you and your team
Just need to back off (hah), get off my block, give me the ball
I said it's my rock (hah), I'm starting a line-up by getting y'all to
Bring the livestock (hah), throw all your money in the pot
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot (hah)
When we come right through, tell me what you really gon' do?
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip (huh)
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams
Like crash cars, who do they be? They be the Monstars!

[Pre-Chorus: B-Real, Method Man & Busta Rhymes]
We want it all (all)
We're unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor)
You can't take none of this hardcore
(what is she talking about? hardcore)
In the game, we take you to war (war)
You ain't seen nothing like this before (before)

[Chorus: Method Man]
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high (high)
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low (low)

La noche maléfica
Comienza a sentirse caótica
Pinche calor!
Que pinche calor! Eioh!
Que pinche calor
Que calor, que calor aah!
Sube la música. Muévete y gime
Pisale a cien por la libre

Ay ay ay el sudor nos estorba
Ay ay ay nos quitamos la ropa
Goza que goza
Goza la cosa malosa ven!
Goza que goza
Goza la cosa malosa ey!
Goza que goza
Tu cosa y mi cosa... ¿cómo?

Entremos sin freno a la perdición!

Reply (feat. Lil Uzi Vert),A Boogie Wit da Hoodie,"

[Verse 1: Lil Uzi Vert]
Woah, if I write (It's JoeFromYO)
If I write you, girl, will you reply? (Go Grizz)
Follow my commands, come on, girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all them lies in your eyes
But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight
Just so I could have my way, rubbin' on your thighs
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, but if I (But if I)
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply? (Would you reply?)
You know I used to be a thief up in the night (Yeah, yeah)
And you don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (Yeah, yeah)
What if I was to put my life up on the line? (On the line)
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket, you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Uh, cry for me, for me now
No one can slow me down
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off a Perc', gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into it 'til she numb
Every time she moan, she be like, ""Uh""
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game 'cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better, baby, just pray about it

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I play about it, but don't you go be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more before you changed your body
Then you did your body, girl, yeah, you really changed about it

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
It's couples out here that's not eatin', we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, it ain't no way around you
Ain't nothin' to say about it, got niggas pull up and spray about it
I'm gone

[Verse 4: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Yeah, and when I say, ""I'm gone""
Don't just say it right after me like it's some sing along shit
You got mad when I said you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this, make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl, just take it off
I knew that you was nasty the way you take it raw
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy, girl

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie & Lil Uzi Vert]
If I
Woah, if I write
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply?
You know I used to be a thief up in the night
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
But what if I put on a disguise for the night?
And I can see all the lies in your eyes (Yeah, yeah)
You don't want this type of guy, right
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties (Yeah)

Find an Island,BENEE,"

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Verse 1]
Both shared a single rope
Trying to stay afloat
The treasure that you blew
When I was tied to you
We reeled each other in
Got caught up in the wind
Our sails, they pulled too hard
And we fell off our raft

[Pre-Chorus]
If our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Post-Chorus]
Find an island
Find an island

[Verse 2]
Slowly you drifted off
Putting us on the rocks
No longer want to know
Where you make plans to go
I built this boat to last
You chose to move too fast
A storm has swept right through
And washed away of you

[Pre-Chorus]
If our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Hey!)
A shipwreck lost at sea
Where nobody goes, no search party (Hey!)
Nobody knows but me

[Post-Chorus]
Find an island
Find an island

[Pre-Chorus]
And if our own mistakes are too much to take
If this just won't work and we can't find a way
Maybe our maps go different ways, go different ways

[Chorus]
Find an island far away from me (Far away from me)
A shipwreck lost at sea (At sea)
Where nobody goes, no search party (Party)
Nobody knows but me
Find an island far away from me (Away from me)
A shipwreck lost at sea (At sea)
Where nobody goes, no search party (Party)
Nobody knows but me

I've been lonely, mm, ah, yeah

I loathe romancing and its offer, I'll be damn true, tried
I'm only dancin' by myself so I don't slam my hours
Compostable cups, pop a penny, I-I can't stress this enough
I would hate to mess things up, but my boogie still stays restless as fuck, yeah

[Chorus: BENEE & Gus Dapperton, BENEE]
I know I fucked up, I'm just a loser
Shouldn't be with ya, guess I'm a quitter

Monsta,BENEE,"

[Verse 1]
I'm tryna fall asleep
Something doesn't feel right
A chill crawls up my skin
A tinglin' down my limbs
A shadow in the night
My God, it gave me such a fright
I see him standing right outside
His face is red, his eyes are white

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it that he wants from me?
Maybe he just feels lonely
What is it that he has in mind?
Why has he come here at this time?

[Chorus]
A monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night

[Verse 2]
Wake up in a magic cave
Here's me trying to be brave
But then instead of eatin' me
He offers me a blueberry

[Pre-Chorus]
What is it that he wants from me?
Maybe he just feels lonely
What is it that he has in mind?
Why has he come here at this time?

[Chorus]
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night

[Bridge]
The monster walks me to a pot
It seems like time is all I got
He puts my head inside, I'm not ready to die
Instead of burning out alive, I see my room, flames rising high
He wasn't tryna hurt me, was only tryna save me

[Chorus]
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night
The monster takes me away
From my safe space
Into the night

Drifting,BENEE,"

I'm on a rollercoaster on a mission to the stars
An adventure they encounter, on a journey to Mars
Spacegirl lookin' at me, she has a silver heart
Robo boy not far from her, body with no bones
She takes a sip of a magic potion, and her hair starts to explode
Has he poisoned her, I wonder?
Will she fall for him, he hopes
She turns into a flower, robo boy left blind
He asks her if she feels alright

[Chorus: BENEE]
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space
And finding our way
Finding our way

[Verse 2: Jack Berry]
Looks around the corner, but Pluto's where I lie
Looking out to the skies, hopin' she'll arrive
My body's made of metal, but my heart's of human kind
Foolish, I see the light, she won't come down tonight
She wanna know me, she wanna know me
But I'm a different type
She wanna see me, she wanna see me
But I refuse to fly
Hope for the best, here I rest, she knows that I'll be fine
(Hope I've got time)

[Chorus: BENEE]
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Finding my way
Space, we're all driftin' through space
Space, we're all driftin' through space

You weren't helping me, no

When I lost you
Nothing was good
No longer happy anymore
Had to let it go

Ooh, I thought I found the one
But clearly, I was blue (Babe)
Blue

[Verse 2]
Why would I stay?
You forced me away
You were nice, 'til you were not
We always fought
Fought a lot
I wonder why you took so long
To realise that the love was gone
Never, ever felt so bad

Ooh, I thought I found the one
But clearly, I was blue (Babe)
Blue

Tongue Tied (with YUNGBLUD & blackbear),Marshmello,"

I'm trapped outside, inside my mind
If you feel like, that you're tongue-tied
Then we're tongue-tied together

[Verse 1: YUNGBLUD]
Every morning, I ride on a carousel
To the sides of my mind that I cannot help
Had to die in Heaven just to get to Hell
Fell when the lights went out now
My real friends act like they don't know me
This headache's giving me a nosebleed
My silence is killing me slowly
I can't keep tuning it out and

[Pre-Chorus: YUNGBLUD]
I been suffering
Been makin' friends with all my sins
I need savin', I need savin'
You won't save me ever again
I'm feeling counterfeit
Been rolling silence 'round my lips
I need savin', I need savin'
You won't save me ever again

'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue-tied

Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together
Tongue-tied together
Yeah yeah, uh-uh

[Verse 2: blackbear]
You done changed, you done changed, you done switched up for sure
You ain't lose me in the summer, you lost me at ""Hello""
Anytime you see me smilin', it was probably for show
All the memories are blurry, so I let 'em burn slow
I ain't seen you in a minute, where did all the time go?
You was outta pocket when you told me ""Die slow""
I was going through the shits, I kept it down low
Tongue-tied, tongue-tied, what we had was all lies

[Pre-Chorus: blackbear]
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me ever again
People change, people change, people switch up
It's okay, you can't save me

'Cause I feel my life's been so tongue-tied
I'm trapped outside, inside my mind (Inside my mind)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez & Jagged Edge]
It feels like forever I've been waiting
Waiting just to get you back, yeah, yeah
You've been moving stingy with your time
Knowing that I put it all on the line
And all them fucking secrets, girl, ain't working for me

Never felt like I feel, and I'll fuck you right, I will
You fucking right I will
I'll make it so no one could ever fuck you like I will
I know your type for real, I know you like to feel
All of the things I said I won't do, but tonight I will
All this Hennessy and Mo'-eezy get me right for real
No one said it was easy to feel how you like to feel
Well, I'm your type for real, you know the hype is real
You know my situation, you got these bitches hatin' (Hating, hating)
And you just tell me, ""Say when""
Jumpin' through these obstacles to find my way in
And it ain't no Usher, but I'm a superstar (Yeah, yeah)
Now come get this and I'll show you who you are

It's so good the way you're touching me (I'm just sayin')
It's so good when you say you love it, baby (Look, Tory Lanez, uh)
It's so good, you say love the real (Love the real)
I wrote the words, for real
To tell how I feel

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Let's do that again
Let's be bad again
Got me faded

Told you go provoke it 'cause I see it
I could feel it, and you need it, baby

Lil' mama getting it in, she fit the school and the gym into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick

She put that pussy on me, she know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap, yo, I make it clap, yo
I have them haters asking, ""How you up in that Rolls?""
And how them umbrellas coming out of locked doors?
How the front doors open up like the back doors?
I'll be like, ""You ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on the beach sittin' up""
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us
She said, ""That champagne nasty,"" spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks want tapes, I am not gone
But it's been five times, you ain't catch on
Maybe on the next song

I'd spend my life in your box, don't need no codefendant
Go 'head, cut these niggas off like they have no existence
They can't go the distance, I'm oh-for-oh for instance
Fuck the gym, let me pull up and give that stroke of fitness
She a five-star shawty, still down to go for Denny's
Down to go for Wendy's
McDonald's chicken fries, thickest thighs
Seen it in her eyes, shawty know I know I seen her
Netflix and chill, and we can go to dinner
My schedule busy, but for you, girl, I'll make no agenda
You got no contenders
You kept it hot for me all in my cold Decembers
No pretendin'

Only thing I care about is who gon' get you home
My cigar full of this weed so I can switch the tone
We stumble to my house drunk, is anybody home?
Words slurrin' and my vision blown, different zone
Room spinnin', I don't know
Unzip my pants and get to blowin', you so nasty
Then what's up with me?
You stayed up tonight to fuck with me
Mmh, lucky me
Gucci panties, sit that pussy on some double G's
Fifty pairs of those'll only cost a couple G's, yeah
Just give me something to work with
Something with purpose
First time that we fucked, girl, you was nervous
Moanin' 'fore I even started touchin' the surface

Whatever you want, hah
Whatever you want if you that quiet, shit

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
She want it now and fast
Grabbin' and smackin' ass, make it last
Beat me to the finish, wave the checkered flag
Toe tag, left the pussy on a deathbed
Been milkin' the game since I was breastfed
Long enough to know that women with lisps give the best head
But not with braces
Your pussy talking's the only conversation, yap, yap
Grab her hair, pull her track back
Got somethin' to prove
Not from Houston but I got somethin' to screw at all times
She said it's all mine
All dimes, y'all fuck with nickels
I be in them guts, pokin' them sides until it tickles
Squeeze the Charmin on her soft ass
No, I don't pay 'em to come, I pay 'em to go, ho
No credit, all cash (Ching)
Be slidin' up and use a worthful transaction
And then just hop up off my dick with no attachments
Usin' prophylactics (Hah)
Safe to say this song is whatever you want
But it's limited to this penis and a blunt
Holler at me, Luda

Whatever you want (You want)
More than happy to provide it
Wet like Poseidon
Whatever you want (Yeah)
Oh, shawty, don't you deny it
It feel like we flyin'

You know I can provide it (I can provide it)

Ooh, back it up, let me smoke it, drag it up
You be wantin' me every time that I'm rollin’, actin’ up
Said I want you, girl, I want you, but I told you that enough
I done showed you that enough
No, this shit ain't addin’ up, oh, no, no
I love your girl, nigga
I keep it so thorough with her
I know that's your world, nigga

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But every time you try to call her over there, lil' mama stay
She say, ""Fuck that nigga""
When I put it in her rib, I say, ""Is it his?""
She say, ""Fuck that nigga""
Now, you keep it ice cold, you leave my nights froze
I know you don't love that nigga
Like you love me, ayy

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
But she won’t
I hope you got a side bitch, nigga
'Cause your main ain't comin' home
I got her in that zone, she out her thongs
And what this is? My nigga, I don't know
I bought her brand new heels so she could touch her toes
And her nigga hatin' like he was before
And she been here waitin' to fuck me to my song (Ooh, ayy)
I hate to see that look in your eyes (Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I, I hate to see that look in your eyes (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Bought her brand new heels so she could touch her toes (Ayy)
I can see it (Ayy)
I hate to see that look in your eyes

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But every time you try to call her over there, lil' mama stay
She say, ""Fuck that nigga"" (She say, ""that nigga"")
When I put it in her rib, I say, ""Is it his?""
She say, ""Fuck that nigga"" (Oh, she say, ""Fuck that nigga"")
Now, you keep it ice cold, you leave my nights froze
I know you don't love that nigga (You don't love, no, no, no, no)
Like you love me, ayy

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
You're young, you got options, it's reasons why you don't listen
You love takin' flights, hoppin' on 'em when your man's distant (Oh)
You made moves in your city and did not get no permission
You're not threatened by a good time whenever we're kissin' (Oh)
Stayed up late for it (Stayed up)
Waited up, stayed up, smeared up your makeup
Girl, I'll make up for it (For it)
That NBA nigga that you fuck is in town
And you're still down to break up for this
He ain't gon' like me after this one
Man, that nigga might wanna fight me after this one
He wifes you down
I won't even call you wifey after this one
'Cause I ain't gon' lie, you did him shiesty after this one
It was pricey after this one
Spent his credit cards on me, you hit the jeweler and made moves
You got me icey after this one
You was Leo status, couldn't call you Pisces after this one
You was nice before this but then got triflin' after this one
Hope you like me after this one
'Cause you're my—

Lips are tellin' me yes, yes
Kissin' on my neck, neck
Should I stay? Should I go?

Your hot boy style drivin' me wild

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I chop trees in a wrap and get high
We go back like four flats on the ride
Put the Ds on the 'Lac when I slide
Baby, ooh, you got time for a youngin' like me
'Cause I flex, Amiri jean, white tee
And I know in the back of my mind
I'm way too wavy for you not to cosign
Wait, I got options on the phone
And wait, you done caught me all alone and playin' games
Ain't my style and you good at drivin' me wild

Lips are tellin' me yes (Yes)

Kissin' on my neck (My neck)
Should I stay? (Should I stay?)
Should I go? (Should I go?)

[Verse 2: Mýa]
Have you twisted like a rolled J
When you leave here lovin' my taste
If you get caught up in the flame
Just don't be actin' crazy
I won't play with your emotions
When I go in and I throw it back
I don't hold back
And I'm just sayin' them hoes can't handle
So what if we stay in the moment for too long?
'Cause really feelings be takin' over, way too strong
Ooh, if I hit it one time
Ooh, then it's gonna end up mine
And oh, if I get it twice, fuck around
Change your last name and your whole life

Lips are tellin' me yes (Yes)
Kissin' on my neck (My neck)
Should I stay? (Should I stay?)
Should I go? (Should I go?)

Should I stay?
Should I go?

I won't lose sleep over this, no
Got me jumpin' out the window, fourty-fifth floor
Moods that you get me, babe
Things that I did to you, this is you gettin' me back
And I need more to love you
I've been prayin' that some peace gonna come through
How you gon' be my enemy when I love you?
You know I need your energy when you come through
You knew I found love when I seen you
Seein' you was somethin' that I ain't never seen before
But I seen the beach shore, you was all aboard my marina
Demeanor, scale of one to ten, 15

Fuck with a nigga head, no good reason
Dress real spiffy anytime, it's pool season

Appreciate a nigga make we wanna do somethin'

Still Waiting (feat. Trey Songz),Tory Lanez,"

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I really hope you never ever get to love me
I'm thinkin' of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin', you got me right where I wanna
Right where I wanted to be when you would love me
Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart, but girl, you don't know
I tried to show you affection, but no, it won't show
I told you, ""Baby, just wait, we need some time and all""
I told you just love me, give me some time to ball
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
With my confidence, took every ounce to holler
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin', sippin' on bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Ooh, you used to call just to tell me
That you ain't all the way get it, but, girl, you felt me
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel C's
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
I thought you was takin' a W, it was just an L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still hopin' and prayin' that you'll be my somethin'
Out layin', and hopin' prayin' that you done datin' me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
Tryna treat you better than he can

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I know you that you ain't really 'bout to dub me
I know you wanna tell me that you love me
Girl, I know you wanna ride it like a Harley
Know you wanna let me swim in that tsunami
Swear I never felt like this way 'bout nobody
Swear I never felt this way 'bout nobody
Girl, you got me doing things that's just not me
Sprung over you, girl, I cannot be
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)
I can't get you out my mind, girl
You know you've been actin' out of line, girl
Don't say, ""Not today,"" 'cause today I got the time, girl
I been actin' like I'm fine, girl
Goin' insane, losin' my brain
You playin' these games, but you know I ain't
I don't be trippin' off bitches, this strange
Not to call you out your name, you know you my main
Man, fuck this fame
How they came in our world, changed everything?
Right away, in a day
Niggas hate, bitches hate
Niggas fake, bitches fake

[Interlude]
Hey, look at him, man
I hope he doesn't hurt you too bad

[Refrain: Trey Songz]
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Really, baby, you should never get to love me
Pillow talkin' with niggas and tryna dub me
You really got the audacity to discuss me
You really got some audacity, you disgust me
And it'd kill me to say these things about you but
I know the way you think about the two of us
I know the way you think about movin' on
But me, girl, I'm not used to maneuverin' much
Tell me I'm doin' enough
Tell me I'm doin' too much
Tell me that you've been in love
Girl, you not doin' enough
I threw the towel in twenty times, I threw it too much
Baby, this shit been a lot
Plus you've been doin' enough
You can't lie, you got time
You heard stories about my drip
Why does it take for me to do somethin' good
For you to come around? That's why I drift
And I know (Know), you's a pro (Pro)
Known for heartbreak after the sheets
I'm tryna keep my composure, I'm a soldier
And deep down, I'm still a G, so (Yeah)

You wouldn't keep runnin' back
Oh, it's so hard to hold back
When you keep coming back, I'm glad, yeah
And when I need her back, I just put it on replay
Fly her to Miami, in the city where the Heat play
Had her in the sheets, finna cut her like a DJ
Fifteen bottles like a quince
She don't pay attention to that him say and she say
Said it two times, then I jinxed it
Saw right through me, had a cup full of lies as I drinked it, uh
Only gonna get it when she want it
New Givenchy, Birkin bag, girl, I was goin' in
Now you got some', baby, flaunt it
Wishin' I kept it honest

Oh, you got some, oh, you got some
Oh, you got somebody

Oh, you got somebody
But you won't stop frontin', you won't stop frontin'
You won't stop frontin' on it, babe (Runnin' back to me)

[Chorus: Ashanti & Tory Lanez]
See, when I get the strength to leave (Runnin' back)
You, you can learn to appreciate me (Runnin' back to me)

You mad as fuck when I spit these facts
'Cause you can spend it ten ways (Ten ways)
Never cared about your money, regardless of what my friends say
'Cause there is nothing that they can say

No scratch on it, no Spud, no MacKenzie, uh

That you ain't never gonna change, never gonna change

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Draft you to the team like Kobe in '96
Blue and orange drops like Ewing signed to the Knicks
You fine and you thick, get you assigned to the dick
Have you runnin' back and forth like suicides in this bitch
Do or dies in this bitch, like shoot from line in this bitch
I stunt so hard, I stuff credit cards in Goyards
Your face, no flaws, no case, no charge
Pulled up in BMs, we spendin' daily per diems
From AM to the PM, you would hop inside my bed
Get it wetter than, what's that line? Uh
Spray 'em where you see 'em
That's why I'm payin' no attention to chicks, I'm playin' in my DM
I know dropout Rovers, pop out sofas
Was with me when I wasn't eatin', we would pop out Stouffer's
You see, that's why I'm still fuckin' with you
Head down, ten toes, still thuggin' with you (Word)
Takin' long flights out to DR
I'm still in Palos, back to Caicos
Trips for the chick that swing them hips like Miss Juegos
From questions like, ""How'd your day go?""
I spend it, extended the suite another week
In Dego, just to watch the day go
As far as bankroll, bank go
I can speak for it with the trips like sprain on ankle
I keep mami on everyone of 'em, shit, I'm sonnin' 'em
Niggas talkin' crazy to bae, I point the gun at 'em
Super hell shit pop up, dun-dun-dun at 'em
Was with me back when I was broke, and so I run it up
Anything for you, I swerve in the lane for you
Hop in the drop top, still work in the rain for you
Nurture this pain for you
'Cause even days that it ain't workin'
I'm still lurkin' and hurtin', in pain for you
See the art was I was shootin' from the heart
But what's shootin' from the heart with a worthless aim for you?
Yeah

Thoughts (feat. Lloyd & Lil Wayne),Tory Lanez,"

[Intro: Lloyd]
Here (Ah)
She's fine too, but I want you (Ah)
Slowly, driftin' slowly
Yeah, if you could see the thoughts that's in my head

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Slowly, driftin' slowly (Slow)
Got my eyes spinnin' so slowly like the two hands in my Rollie
It's my time, come put that on me (Come put that on me)
You'll still be my one and only, or my lonely, or my doley
What's outside, and just don't OD on them girls that came before you
I won't OD on them guys that came before me, oh, I
Movin' lowkey (Movin' lowkey on—)
Beat that pussy like you owe me
Girl, you know me, and that's all me, oh, I
We both did thangs before, feelings and things involved
But I'm not to blame at all

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These just ain't words (Words) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words, I'm addicted (Yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
On my mind
Yeah, you been in my head, and I just don't know why
But since you left my bed, girl, my sun don't shine
I just haven't been myself, no, this ain't good for my health
So tell me, can you help it?
Baby, let's remind each other love is for us if we don't rewind
Let's keep movin' forward, leave the past behind
It don't matter who's before me, I know that you adore me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne]
These just ain't words (Word) that I'm spittin' (Yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These ain't words), I feel a spark (Oh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Can't help it)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Oh, I)
These just ain't words (Yeah)
I'm addicted (Yeah, I'm addicted)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Yeah
And if I see you with that other nigga (Mmm)
I might spaz if I see you with that other bitch (Mmm)
I might dance if you see me with that other bitch (Damn)
You might harass, we can't be friends, I'm too far in (Yeah)
Open my mind (Yeah) and you walked in
I cannot be for real
When I went and copped the Richard
It was therapeutic, had to free my mind (Mind)
When I cut off all my bitches
It was only you I couldn't leave behind (Yeah)
Polly want a cracker, she said, ""Please don't call me Polly""
She want me to call her bad words, these just ain't words
And you know I love you like good food
You know you're fuckin' with a good dude
You know you givin' me good brain
Like you graduated from a good school

[Chorus: Tory Lanez, Lil Wayne & Both]
These just ain't words (These just ain't words, words)
That I'm spittin' (That I'm spittin', yeah)
If you could see the thoughts (Ooh)
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head (In my head)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I feel a spark (Feel a spark, ooh)
It's either that or I'm just caught up in my head (Ooh, in my head)
I can't help it (Yeah)
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish (Yeah, oh, I)
These just ain't words (These just ain't words)
I'm addicted (I'm addicted, yeah)
If you could see what it's my head, I need you in my bed, oh

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
These just ain't words
Thoughts that's in my, thoughts that's in my head
These just ain't words
Caught up in my head
I can't help it
All the ways you did your thing, that made me selfish
These just ain't words, I'm addicted
If you could see what's in my head, I need you in my bed, oh

She like that top dropped, she like that talk when it's chopped
She got some bad friends, I'm tryna fuck her
I gotta spread them legs like it was mustard

I gotta play games in it, David and Busters

Tryna remember it all, put on my thinkin' cap
She had on checkerboard pants, think they was pink and black
I told my boy I'ma get her, bet you I link with that
We made a bet wit' our fingers, twisted our pinky back
She might've just been blinkin', that mean she winkin' back
She got a ass like a bar, could sit a drink on that
And I, and I, I gotta let you know
'Cause I, 'cause I, 'cause I can't let you go
And I, and I really just met you, yo
But I, but I see somethin' special though
Ayy, work somethin', can we work somethin' out?
'Cause I'm cashin' out if you're worth somethin'
Doubt, I'ma kill it, baby, bet I merk somethin'
Clout chaser hatin', they gon' make me hurt somethin'
They can't leave us alone, they either thieves or they clones
I got VVS stones, they look like TVs that's on
Won't get points off me, nigga, my defense is on
I can play man-to-man and I can even go zone, listen
Full court, I'ma press you if I like you, shawty
Bull shorts on a nigga like I'm Michael Jordan
Hook first time, Little Mo, I might go show 'em
Fuck it, do it for the second time like I'm Tory

Sims,Lauv,"

[Verse 1]
I wish that you and I lived in The Sims
We could build a house and plant some flowers and have kids
But we're both at some trashy Halloween party downtown
And I'll probably never see you again
I wish that we lived on a VHS
I'd erase the things I said and that I'll probably say again
Hit rewind on all the times I got lost in my head
But I guess I'll never see you again
I'll probably never see you again

[Chorus]
Ooh, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
Maybe then I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, ooh, goddamn
I wish we would've met on another night, baby
In another life, baby
In another

I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have let you
I wouldn't have

[Verse 2]
I wish that we met walkin' round the MoMa
Yeah, I'd say ""Nice to meet you""
Instead of saying ""Nice to know ya""
I'd try to impress you with some bullshit 'bout Monet
At least I wouldn't be too drunk to stay
And I wouldn't have let you slip away

[Chorus]
Ooh, goddamn
I wish we would have met on another night, baby
Maybe then I wouldn't have let you leave me
Yeah, ooh, goddamn

But I, I wanna do whatever you wanna do
If you wanted to, girl, we could cross that line
""Know we've been friends
And love only knows broken ends""
Yeah, that's what you said
But girl, let me change your mind

[Chorus]
Mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause feelings are hard to find

'Cause feelings are hard to find
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Sad Forever,Lauv,"

[Verse 1]
Daydream
Life feels like a daydream
And I just wish that I could wake up
I just wish that I could wake up
My mind whispers in the nighttime
Voices always keeping me up
Telling me that I should give up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause lately I've been in the backseat to my own life
Trying to take control but I don't know how to

[Chorus]
I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to be sad no more
I don't want to wake up and wonder
What the hell am I doing this for
I don't want to be medicated
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

I don't want to be sad forever
I don't want to go one more day
I just want to wake up and realize everything's gonna be okay
I don't know how else to say it
I don't want to go through that war
I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad
I don't want to be sad anymore

[Verse 2]
I'm coming through to the other side
I'll make it through to tomorrow
'Cause that's all I can do today, do today

Trying to take control but I don't know how to

Drugs & The Internet,Lauv,"

[Verse 1]
Another life, another story
She walked out, said I was boring
About 3 AM, that's when I called my friends
We hit the bar, sent myself flying
Shit I said I'm never trying
'Til the bitter end, but every now and then
I wonder what it feels like to be more than I am

[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette

[Post Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna base my actions
On reactions or the things they say
And I don't wanna hit delete
On all the parts of me that they might hate
So now I'm laying in my bed
And I can't get out my head
It's all because, all because

[Chorus]
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, is he a winner yet?
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette
I traded all my friends for drugs and the internet
Ah shit, am I a winner yet?
Look quick, hasn't hit him yet
Mom's back home with a drink and a cigarette

Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet
Ooh, ooh
Still hasn't hit him yet

Can't unmiss you and I need you now
Yeah, I, I, oh I, yeah

Tokyo Drifting (with Denzel Curry),Glass Animals,"

[Part I]

[Intro: Denzel Curry]
Huh, huh, huh

[Verse 1: Dave Bayley]
Two things 'bout the geez, you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40, windows up
He rolls, like he really doesn't give a-
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket

[Bridge: Dave Bayley]
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

[Verse 2: Dave Bayley]
Scoot-scoot, boy, racer to the super-club
Let rip, like you drank all of the tequila
Get loose, streetfighter, tear it up
Fresh footwear drippin' out of you onto the rug

[Part II]

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Denzel Curry]
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Wavey Davey's on fire
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh)
Wavey Davey's on fire
Oh, you still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh)
Huh, huh
Huh, huh
Huh, huh

[Verse 3: Denzel Curry]
Ayy, what is everybody talkin' 'bout?
When they wanna live fast, but they'd rather walk it out
Niggas wanna talk about a G, but I spent a G on the twelve teeth in my mouth (Huh, huh, huh)
Diamonds aquatic, it feel like a trout on my wrist (Wrist)
Or a spout on my wrist with a spider up in it (In it)
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it, I'm on it, I'm in it
If you try and take it, the clip get extended
I'm back on my bullshit, like Jordan on Pippen
If this is my life then I'm Tokyo drifting (Uh)

[Chorus: Dave Bayley & Denzel Curry]
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor (Yeah, oh)
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh, now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster, feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Wavey Davey's on fire (Yuh, yuh, yuh, okay)
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh, huh)
Wavey Davey's on fire (Yuh, yuh, yuh, okay)
You still got it, you still got it alright, yeah (Huh, huh, huh)

Cántalo,Ricky Martin,"

[Letra de ""Cántalo""]

[Intro: Ricky Martin]
Siente lo que siento yo
Derritiendo el frío porque vengo con mi gente
(Oh-le-oh-lei)
De la tierra son las estrella' y del cielo son los pionero'
De las nubes salen los fuego', los que no se apagan con hielo
Quien le tiene miedo al sereno no resiste ni un aguacero
Báilalo, que esto está bueno, muévelo, que esto es un juego

[Verso 1: Residente, Residente & Ricky Martin]
No, no
No quiero un trofeo gigante
Como Héctor, yo lo que quiero es que mi gente cante
Vamo' pa' 'lante
Hoy no nos paran ni con tranquilizante de elefante
El dinero, aunque sea abundante, no vale
Aquí todo' somo' importante'
Con el mismo semblante, suda'o y sin bañar
Pero comoquiera elegante'
Esa cadera mírala cómo cocina
Gourmet como bacalao sin espina'
Llovió y esto no se ha acaba'o
Bailamo' hasta con los zapato' moja'os
La' cara' linda' que lindas son
Pa' esa sonrisa un besito 'e bombón
Corazón de melón, melón
Agarra tu pareja antes de que suene el trombón

[Coro: Ricky Martin]
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Habla pueblo, cántalo
(Oh-lo-lo-lei-la-ni-na-na-na)

[Verso 2: Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin & Bad Bunny]
Que lo baile San Juan, que lo baile La Habana
Apreta'íto y bien suda'o como en Copacabana
Que mala ere' Juliana
Demasia'o de sabrosura como pa' no verte mañana
Con los pies caliente' y la cerveza fría
Deja que el alma monte la coreografía
Que yo tampoco sé bailar, pero confía (Ey, ey, ey)
Que aprendo antes que salga la luz del día (Ey, ey)
Muévete como tu bandera
El tiempo pasa y por nadie espera
La calle está prendí'a, está en candela
Bailando sin zapato' con los pie' acapella
Con orgullo te digo dónde está mi abuela
Gracias Maelo y Lavoe por la escuela
Que cante mi gente, le' prendo' una vela
Con Cristo mirando toda' las favela', yeh

[Coro: Ricky Martin]
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Habla pueblo, cántalo

[Refrán: Ricky Martin]
La brisa y el viento no paran de soplar
Y las velas no se apagan
Tu marea embriaga mi cintura
La luna azul, las gota' de sol

[Coro: Ricky Martin]
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Habla pueblo, cántalo

My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up),Fall Out Boy,"

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh

[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
My songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark

[Verse 2]
The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see

[Pre-Chorus]
My songs know what you did in the dark

[Chorus]
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire

Light em up, up, up

The Phoenix,Fall Out Boy,"

[Intro]
Put on your war paint

[Verse 1]
You are a brick tied to me that’s dragging me down
Strike a match and I’ll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
(Put on your war paint)
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

[Chorus]
Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I’m going to change you like a remix
Then I’ll raise you like a phoenix

[Verse 2]
Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
""You broke our spirit,"" says the note we pass

[Pre-Chorus]
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you’re waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart

Hey, young blood, doesn’t it feel
Like our time is running out?
I’m going to change you like a remix

Wearing our vintage misery

I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?

My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah

Young Volcanoes,Fall Out Boy,"

When Rome's in ruins
We are the lions, free of the Colosseums
In poison places, we are anti venom
We're the beginning of the end

Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won

Do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?

C'mon, make it easy, say I never mattered

Du du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 1]
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Verse 2]
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

[Bridge]
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

[Chorus]
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries

Of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog
Of all your fever dreams

It might be your wound but they’re my sutures

May nothing but death do us part

She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman

Irresistible,Fall Out Boy,"

[Verse 1]
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name

[Chorus]
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

[Bridge]
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in but, honey, I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war

[Chorus]
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way (yeah), I love the way (yeah)
I love the way you hurt me, baby

I'm calling you from the future
To let you know we've made a mistake

And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions

And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah

I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one

I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones
(You're just the last of the real ones)
You're just the last of the real ones

I've Been Waiting,Fall Out Boy,"

[Verse 1]
These are your good years
Don't take my advice
You never wanted the nice boys, anyway

And I'm of good cheer
'Cause I've been checking my list
The gifts you're receiving from me will be

[Pre-Chorus]
One awkward silence
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep
Staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year's for you to dedicate
Your last breath to me before you bury yourself alive

[Chorus]
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less

[Verse 2]
Happy New Years, baby
You owe me the best gift I will ever ask for
Don't call me up when the snow comes down
It's the only thing I want this year

[Pre-Chorus]
One awkward silence
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep
Staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year for you to dedicate
Your last breath to me before you bury yourself alive

[Chorus]
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree (Don't come home for Christmas)
Merry Christmas, I could care less

[Chorus]
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree (Don't come home for Christmas)
Merry Christmas, I could care less

[Outro]
Sweet! They've recorded a Christmas song!
They must've spent a lot of money on this...
But this one time, this one Christmas I got this-

Dear Future Self (Hands Up),Fall Out Boy,"

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the ""Boom, boom,"" we are breaking through

[Verse 1: Patrick Stump, Wyclef Jean & Both]
We prepared for the turbulence
But there's no preparing for this
Got paid on Tuesday, but I'm still broke when the weekend ends
Another trip around the sun, it was a good run
Just mixing all of my prescriptions with my problems
Yeah, streets are full of seasons
Saw what they did to Jesus
Dude'll kill you for no reason, and charge you for treason
I know this one for a fact
My phone, they got it on tap
'Cause every time I'm talkin' I can hear them in the back (Hands up)

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the ""Boom, boom,"" we are breaking through
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom

Knock, knock, knock, knock, who is it? (Hands up)

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump]
She said this is a surprise visit
It's my fantasy, I'm gon' live it
Hands up, and don't you refuse it
I wanna tattoo you on me
Just look what you created
Dear future self, I hope it's going well
I'm drunk on cheap whiskey in an airport hotel, yeah

[Chorus: Patrick Stump]
Hands up, ready for the boom
Never mind the rocket launcher, talking 'bout a tune
You can hear us comin' with the zoom
Listen to the ""Boom, boom,"" we are breaking through

Bob Dylan,Fall Out Boy,"

[Verse 1]
When they say, ""You and what army?""
I guess they're talking about you and me
Baby, nobody will love you
Nobody will love you like-like I do
I guess that's half true

[Pre-Chorus]
Come down, come down
Come down from your holy mountain
I'm down, I'm down
To put your shame on a billboard for a second
Sometimes, sometimes
The only way out is through, through

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?
I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah

So what fates do we share?
Windows down, wind in your hair
Baby, no one ever thinks of you
No one ever thinks of you as much as I do
Not, not even you

Come down, come down
Come down from your holy mountain

Pain to regret but it's more that I get

Beam and a Jag', got the Benz' on the lot
Went and copped me a crib just to park up the drop (Benz, Benz, gang, gang)

So I'll bleed for you
I'll do anything, just tell me what you need
Take the lead, set me free
Blood on the land from the man that I had to kill
Just to get my hands on my goddamn happy pill

Just want another shot with you
Gotta find something that can get me through

And I thank God I found it

We can keep runnin' from reality (And I can't see clearly)
Don't leave me empty-handed

Oh, let me get a glimpse of paradise before I'm dead

I don't care what you do, what you know
Is it love? is it human?
What the fuck are we doing?
And I don't know if there is a god
But if she is a woman
I would say that she's droppin' the ball

Put me on a pedestal and tell me where to sign
Pleasing you so hard, am I doing it right?

Twilight
Twilight
Twilight
Twilight

[Verse 1]
It's a nuisance
Hesitation's calling out my name, it...
Started new, but it's old shit now
Pulls me down to the ground
I'd rather live my life in purple hazes
Right before the darkness falls (Darkness falls)
Just let me take you, just let me take you
To the place where it all began

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all, it was all like a dream to me
It was all, it was all, that's how it seemed to me

[Chorus]
That's how it seemed to me in the twilight
That's how it seemed to me in the twilight (It was all, it was all)

[Verse 2]
Like a vision
Like a transcendental superstition
You appear in the nick of time
Where have you been all my life?
Want you to take me by the hand and shake me
Shake me to the core again (To the core again)
I still remember, I still remember
How it felt when it all began

[Pre-Chorus]
It was all, it was all like a dream to me
It was all, it was all, that's how it seemed to me

[Chorus]
That's how it seemed to me in the twilight (It was all, it was all)
That's how it seemed to me in the twilight (It was all, it was all, it was all)

[Outro]
Take me back to the place with no name
I wanna forget, I wanna run away (That's how it seemed to me)
Man, you're lame, chasin' fame
Suffocate in L.A. (That's how it seemed to me)
Take me back to the place with no name (That's how it seemed to me)
I wanna forget, I wanna run away (That's how it seemed to me)
Man, you're lame, chasin' fame
Suffocate in L.A.

When He's Done,Tei Shi,"

[Verse 1]
Jonny says
He plays the guitar every day
I'm impressed
I'll believe whatever, I guess
And I keep thinking
I can't stop these wheels from turning inside of me
Loving him so recklessly is gonna make a mess out of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when he's done ('Cause when he's done)
He'll have taken every little bit of my heart
That's how it starts (That's how it starts)
And when he's gone (And when he's gone)
He'll take the words I wrote and throw them away
That's what they say

[Verse 2]
Pass the test
Laugh at everything that he says
Get undressed
Drink up if you wanna forget
And I keep thinking this is love, I wanna feel it inside of me, hey
Bound to him and boundaries are bound to make a mess out of me

[Chorus]
'Cause when he's done
He'll have taken every little bit of my heart
That's how it starts
And when he's gone
He'll take the words I wrote and throw them away
That's what they say

Red Light,Tei Shi,"

How many nights did I waste on you? (On you)
Burning my eyes in this smoke filled room (For two)
I was giving everything then
Ooh, I couldn’t even see it
Looking at you in the rearview now

You were just a red light (I shoulda)
Put you in your place like (I coulda)
Say it to your face like (I woulda)
If I knew then‚ what I know now
Hit the road tonight like (I shoulda)
Take the wheel and drive by (I coulda)
There would be no second chances‚ baby
If I knew then‚ what I know now

[Verse 2]
You walk around like the world owes you (Oh you)
Made me believe that I owed you too
I know you like to play the victim
Blame me 'cause I never fixed you
I finally got you out the picture now

You were just a red light (I shoulda)
Put you in your place like (I coulda)
Say it to your face like (I woulda)
If I knew then, what I know now
Hit the road tonight like (I shoulda)
Take the wheel and drive by (I coulda)
There would be no second chances, baby
If I knew then‚ what I know now

[Bridge]
I’m gonna do what I (shoulda)
I’m gonna do what I (coulda, yeah, yeah)
I’m gonna do what I (woulda)
Do what I‚ I-I, shoulda, coulda

"
Thief,Tei Shi,"

I didn't take you for a thief
You were just running with my feelings
We were moving way too fast
In the dark, in the past

I know you want the moon
But is my love enough
To make it there?
To make it fast?

I've been calling to the sea
Letting go of me is bigger than you (Is bigger than you)
Something you should know
It's just fate to be wandering on your own
Fucking up here
Falling down here

I wasn't looking for the truth
But it's not like we were strangers
I see the parts of me you wear
In your eyes, in your hair

I've been falling to my knees (Falling to my knees)
Letting go of please (Letting go of please)
It's bigger than me (It's bigger than me, baby)
It's something you should see

I know I've been a fool
But is my love enough
To make it fair?
To make it last?

It's okay, it's okay (Okay)
To be wandering on your own
Fucking up here
Falling down here

"
No Juegues,Tei Shi,"

[Letra de ""No Juegues""]

No juegues con mi vida
No juegues con mi amor
Es que te entrego demasiado
Cada vez que te veo

Dicen por ahí (Dicen por ahí)
Querer sin sufrir (Querer sin sufrir)
No vale nada, nada
Ya eso lo aprendí (Ya eso lo aprendí)
Y ahora junto a ti
Mi amor no vale nada
Mi amor no vale nada

No juegues, no juegues
No juegues, no juegues
No juegues, no juegues
No juegues, no juegues
Es que te entrego demasiado
No juegues, no juegues

Es que tú quieres que te lo de todo
Cada vez que te veo pasar te pido
No juegues, no juegues
Te lo pido a ti
Es que tú quieres que te lo de todo
Cada vez que lo veo pasar le digo
Mi amor no vale na'
Y cada vez que lo veo pasar le digo
Mi amor no vale na'
Mi amor no vale na'
Mi amor no vale na'
Mi amor no vale na'

A Kiss Goodbye,Tei Shi,"

[Intro]
When I was young I thought I
I thought I knew it all
That was before I fell in love

[Verse 1]
It came to my surprise and
It ended just the same
Leaving me open on the floor
Why I give myself away
I'll never know

[Chorus]
So I lead with my body
Follow with my head
If you got what you wanted
Let me walk away
I'm on the other side
I don't need a kiss goodbye

[Verse 2]
I got a letter today
It came anonymous
I ripped it open in the flesh
It said
Who
Are
You?

[Chorus]
So I lead with my body
Follow with my head
If you got what you wanted
Let me walk away
I'm on the other side
I don't need a kiss goodbye (I don't need it, I don't need it)

[Bridge]
The love that I have in this heart of mine
I'm keeping it all to myself this time
The love that I have in this heart of mine
I'm keeping it all to myself this time

[Outro]
So I lead with my body
Follow with my head
Was it love that you wanted?
Let me walk away
I'm on the other side
I don't need a kiss goodbye

"
We,Tei Shi,"

Memory, talk to me
Find a place, find a time
With the sun in my eyes
Little skirt, hairy thighs

When I was looking in the mirror
I swear that I could see it clearer then
Before you told me my reflection's not my friend
And now I stand a little nearer
To all the things I thought I'd never get
I try to think of what I lost and what I've found
You and I know

We don't have to talk about it, we don't have to shout
You don't have to understand the way it makes us feel
We know it's real (Middle fingers up)
Real (When they profit off)
The confidence they take away from we
It should be criminal, it's so subliminal

Waves and other time
Ways and other times
Over ways and other times
Over ways and over time
Over waves and over time
Over love and other lies
Under love and over lies
Over you and over I

Waves and other time
Ways and other times
Over ways and other times
Over ways and over time
Over waves and over time
Over love and other lies
Under love and over lies
Over you and over I

Waves and other time
Ways and other times
Over ways and other times
Over ways and over time
Over waves and over time
Over love and other lies
Under love and over lies
Over you and over I

Over animosity
Over all apologies
I forgive all of the things
That you left inside of me
Under-reciprocity
Is what you gave to me
I forgive all of the things
That you left in spite of me

Be Fine,Madeon,"

[Verse 1]
Today the world is gonna do me right
The sun rising in my head
Until I just cannot believe my eyes
And you tell me it's another phase
Does it matter if it's real or not?
I don't think I'll ever have enough
Make it, make it so the fire doesn't stop
Are you listening to me?

Don't tell me that I might
I will be fine again
Tell me that I might
I will be fine again
Tell me that I might
I will be fine
Let my body do me right
I say I will be fine

[Verse 2]
Can I make this my home?
I'm still coming into my own
""You can't keep falling into my arms""

But what is there is all that I knew
When it's time to do what I do
It's all I need from you
Say are you listening to me?

Don't tell me that I might
I will be fine again
Tell me that I might
I will be fine again

No Fear No More,Madeon,"

I know we're not listened to, but

You used to tell me not to dream away
Go chase the safety, not the rush
You say this future is a world away
I think you worry way too much

Hold Me Just Because,Madeon,"

Hold me just because
We're alone together
I've been wasting away on my own
I've been waiting for this to get old
I've been trying my best to get over you

Hold me just because
We're in this together
'Til there's nothing left of me at all
Just a memory you can recall
I was only a child when I fell for you

Hold me one last time so I can let you go
Something on my mind I need to let you know
'Til there's nothing left of me at all
Just a memory you can recall
I was only a child when I fell for you

Hold me just because
Hold me just because
Hold me just because
I'm alone with you

Heavy With Hoping,Madeon,"

How can I explain?
Can you imagine it?
Trying my best
Trying to find happiness
If I belonged
If I had a home anywhere
It's in your heartbeat
Let me be there

[Chorus]
Heavy with hoping
That you know it
That you feel the way I do
Show me you're broken
'Cause I'm frozen
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Shut me up
Shoot me down before I break and tell the truth
Heavy with hoping
Heavy with hoping you love me too

[Verse 2]
If I let you go
We end in tragedy
How would you know
How to get back to me?
If I had a clue
If I had a chance anyhow
This is my last one
I'm nothing without you now

[Bridge]
Even though I broke your heart
And you're all those miles away
Won't you tell me you forgive me?
Won't you bring me home to stay?
Maybe now we could be ready
Maybe this is just a test of faith
So heavy

[Chorus]
Heavy with hoping
That you know it
That you feel the way I do
Show me you're broken
'Cause I'm frozen
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Shut me up
Shoot me down before I break and tell the truth
Heavy with hoping
Heavy with hoping you love me too

Keep us alive up above
And I won't make a plan for who you'll be

I could never have been
When I'm said and done
You'll be there after me

And I won't make a plan for who you'll be
You'll be named after me

Swimming through the rivers of my sorrows
Praying that we'll make it out alive
Everybody's living for tomorrow
What if we were living for tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you
To wear your heart on my sleeve

Hoping for a light to guide us home

To lay your demons on me

Verona,Klingande,"

[Verse 1]
The thing for the hour is save the children
And we're all very serious about that
Because we are expecting the children to save us all
But how can they save us?

[Verse 2]
If they don't even have any examples
Well, what kind of examples, preacher?
Examples of leadership, love, peace, joy, and harmony
Those examples of caring and sharing
See, we must break those generational curses
That plague our families and communities
They must know that knowledge is power
And wisdom is gaining understanding
The Bible says train up a child in the way they should go
And when they become old, huh
They shall not get hope from it
I always hear us preaching that famous slogan
Each one, teach one
But are we doing our best to be effective
In the lives of our children?
Only God can save our souls

Losing U,Klingande,"

[Verse 1]
Warm coffee and a cigarette
We would smoke the last one in my twin sized bed
This moment feels safe and sound
Though we know the storm is coming to take us down

[Chorus]
If we need to say goodbye, I do
If staying here could save your life, I would
I will make you happy, there is nothing I won't do
So I'm losing you

[Post-Chorus]
If staying here could save your life, I would

[Verse 2]
Once and forever, we close this door
The one that leads to Heaven on the second floor
Stay with me 'til the morning comes
Cause all I ever wanted was to show you the sun

If we need to say goodbye, I do
If staying here could save your life, I would
I will make you happy, there is nothing I won't do
So I'm losing you

I know a story about a boy
About a boy I used to know
It's kind of funny, you'd never guess
As he smokes a cigarette

I wished that
I could've shown this kid the road
Follow the lines
Instead of doing this alone
And he was singing

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run, better run, faster than my bullet

A look so pure, I could've sworn
It's not so funny, it's just a mess
Another cowboy in distress

Follow the lines

Keep dressing your demons
But you can't find your soul on the discount rack

That we were drinking on the night we lost it all
Wish I could look you in the eye
Instead of looking at the same four empty walls

Seeing the truth spelled out only makes it worse
Try to swallow the pill, but it doesn't go down
'Cause getting over you doesn't work

Damn you for breaking my–
Damn you for breaking my heart
Damn you for breaking my–
Damn you for breaking my heart

I feel guilty, and my heart shuts down

Damn you for breaking my heart, oh

Now I can barely be inside this room
And what if I just had to hear your voice today?
What if I don't know what else to do?

Now I can barely stand to check my phone
Sometimes I wish he wasn't so good to me
Sometimes I wish my cover would be blown

And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

[Verse 3]
I can't even drive by that old restaurant
(I can't even listen to our song)
How do you get over what's not done
(No, it's not over yet)
I can't even remember what we fought about
And now I wish that we fought hard enough

[Chorus]
And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

[Bridge]
It got so cold inside
I don't know where to go
I wanna tell you why but I don't
If I did, would it change your mind?
I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and I miss you and I miss you
And you don't know it

[Chorus]
And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

The Price I Pay,Haley & Michaels,"

[Verse 1]
Yesterday I gave your side of the bed away
Now I can barely be inside this room
And what if I just had to hear your voice today?
What if I don't know what else to do?

[Verse 2]
I woke up from dreaming you were calling me
Now I can barely stand to check my phone
Sometimes I wish he wasn't so good to me
Sometimes I wish my cover would be blown

[Chorus]
And I miss you and it won't stop
And I miss you and you don't know it
Never thought that I would feel this way
What if's nothing's worth the price I pay?
And I want you and it won't give
And I want you and you don't know it
No, I don't know how to feel this way
What if nothing's worth the price I pay?

[Verse 3]
I can't even drive by that old restaurant

Gonna never stop kissin', kissin’, kissin'
Gonna never stop missin', missin’, missin' you
We can't stay in this place
Never could do things half way
So baby let's get on with it, with it, with it

[Chorus]
No more late night calls at two A.M.
No more breakin' that promise, it won't happen again
No more sleepin' in this bed just one more night
No more sayin' ""I love you"" like we both forgot
We’ve said it’s over, but then it's not
We always need another one more night
We went all in, let’s go all out

[Verse 2]
We always gotta be leavin', leavin', leavin'
You know we can’t leave it, leave it, leave it alone
We can't say goodbye, 'cause you know it don't feel right
No we can't leave that feelin', feelin', feelin', yeah

No more late night calls at two A.M.
No more breakin' that promise, it won't happen again
No more sleepin' in this bed just one more night

We keep on tryin' to fight it
You know we can't fight it, no
So baby let's get on with it, with it, with it

No more late night calls at two A.M.
No more breakin' that promise, it won't happen again

I'm lil mouse bitch I'm all about hella bands
Ak sit on my belt like the gilidan
Free my bros out of prison, 4 boats round his chest strapped
Look like the michellin man. Boat

Natural hair poppin', don't ever get it twisted

Say So,Doja Cat,"

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you really ain't been yourself
Tell me, what must I do to tell my love?
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading

And we can dance all day around it
If you front, then I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream and shout it, babe
But fuck that if you try

I get you hot and moaning, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches there to roll with

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)

Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy?
Shut it, save it, keep it, push
Why you beating 'round the bush?

All of my niggas saying you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of that body I need ass and titties

And acted like I was okay
We just had to work it out

Ain't nobody 'round here wrong

You're pouring your heart out

You held me so down
So down I never grew, oh

When none of them came through
And now I'm stuck in the middle
And baby had to pull me out, oh

Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight
Like the birds of a feather, baby
We real life made for each other
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you

Man, it's heavy on me, it's like a brick on my ring, yeah
Baby on me 'cause I got red in my genes, yeah
Work 'til I cry, bitch, I ain't barely got sleep
Kept the ice on my grill for me to get all of this heat

Beer Never Broke My Heart,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I've had a largemouth bass bust my line
A couple beautiful girls tell me goodbye
Trucks break down, dogs run off
Politicians lie, been fired by the boss

[Pre-Chorus]
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down

[Chorus]
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart

[Verse 2]
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now

[Chorus]
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one

[Chorus]
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

"
Refrigerator Door,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
There's daddy on his John Deere, brand new in '96
Beside me and Bandit playing fetch when I was a kid
A Save the Date, best day of my best buddies life
Anybody else could walk on by, and not blink an eye

[Chorus]
'Cause they're just pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
Just the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door

[Verse 2]
My first day of kindergarten when I was 5 years old
A postcard that my cousin sent from Cancun, Mexico
A list of what Mama needs from the IGA today
Is just one small part of a work of art signed Kenmore in '98

[Chorus]
With all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that I've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's my life on the 'frigerator door

[Bridge]
As life flies by, it spills onto the side
Until it's covered top to bottom with the best days of your life

[Chorus]
And all those pictures hanging side by side
Forgotten memories from another time
And all the places that you've been before
Couple magnets, recipes, and Polaroids
Yeah, but that's our lives on the 'frigerator door
On the 'frigerator door

Even Though I'm Leaving,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Verse 2]
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

[Bridge]
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

[Chorus]
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere

Lovin' On You,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

[Verse 2]
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

[Chorus]
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you

Moon Over Mexico,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I can still see your blue sky blue eyes hangin' on a mango kiss
Hear the waves and the breeze and the Joshua trees
Was just about as good as it gets
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind like I'm right there again

[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

[Verse 2]
The second I left I was kickin' myself
'Cause I knew I should've stayed
Still tequila love drunk, from us wakin' up
Under the Cabo palm leaf shade
And it's crazy I know, but I'd give anything to go
To you and me on that coast, in the midnight glow

[Chorus]
Of a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico

[Bridge]
Taste the salt on the rim, feel the sand on your skin
And the wild in the wind, like I'm right there again

[Chorus]
Under a moon over Mexico
Holdin' onto you as the low tide rolls
Whatever that buzz was, I ain't felt it since
But I can't seem to let it go
And there was a shine in the dark, a flame from a spark
And a lime in a Pacifico
Under a moon over Mexico
Under a moon over Mexico
Over Mexico

1,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
Well I got a call from Rowdy ‘round six o'clock
Sayin' he caught a hankerin’ for a honky tonk
Wants an ice cold beer and a country song
But he didn't want to stay out all night long
Well I ain't the kind to let a buddy drink alone
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
After five diet Millers I was feelin' loose
Singin' karaoke to a TL tune
When a pretty little thing shot me a wink
She said, ""Hey cowboy, could you buy us a drink?""
Well hey, baby doll, I will if you want
But I can't turn it off once I turn it on

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
By half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hits me
5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Bridge: Luke Combs, Brooks & Dunn]
C'mon
Now I've never been the kind to quit
Won't stop 'til I get to the bottom of this
And the night's still young so whatcha say we shotgun one?
Hell we'll shoot one with you Luke, come on Ronnie

[Chorus: Brooks & Dunn, Luke Combs]
There's no stoppin' me once I get to goin'
Put a can in my hand man, I'm wide ass open
The tick-tock of that clock is like a time bomb
About half past 10 I'm half past tipsy
And quarter to 12, man, I done had plenty
The countdowns on when the first beer hit me
5-4-3-2-1 too many
Yeah, 5-4-3-2-1 too many

[Outro]
Come on, that’s a ******* country song right there

Blue Collar Boys,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
We were just river kids
Pickin' up stones like David did
Watchin' them longnecks break off of Freight Train Bridge
We went to church in a Detroit car
Our daddies drank draft at the local bar
With an achin' back just like old Granddad did

[Chorus]
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys

[Verse 2]
We're the white paint peeling off a picket fence
The rust stains covering a Craftsman wrench
When the sun's coming up you can bet we're clocking in
Cash our paycheck, two day break, and do it again

[Chorus]
We like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys

[Bridge]
We're worn out boots and old Levi's
The wind behind the stars and stripes

[Chorus]
And we like cold keg beer and fixin' up trucks
Old bird dogs and the woman we love
Maxwell House steamin' out of a coffee cup
We say our prayers, send 'em to the sky
Bust our backs, barely getting by
Carolina to California up to Illinois
Yeah, there's guys like us
Yeah, there's guys like us
Blue collar boys
Blue collar boys

New Every Day,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I always thought that whiskey was just somethin' that you sipped
I always thought a smoke was somethin’ I'd never do again
I thought I was in control
And I was on a roll

[Verse 2]
I never thought a picture was enough break me down
I never knew a king size bed was just another place to drown
Or how lonely lonely sounds
But man, I get it now

[Chorus]
I'm learnin’ somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

[Verse 3]
I thought I knew it all, but girl, I guess you're showin’ me
I’m findin' out how freedom can feel anything but free
And how hurtin’ hurts like hell
Yeah, as far as I can tell

[Chorus]
I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I’m findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day

[Bridge]
Soon as it's gone I find out
Your memory is still around
And here to stay

[Chorus]
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
All about goodbyes, about overs
All about hang-ups and hangovers
Things I never knew about me
I'm findin' out now since the
Day you made us go our separate ways
Well, I'm learnin' somethin' new
I guess you could say
That I'm learnin' somethin' new every day
Every day

Reasons,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I don't know why you can't buy wine 'round here on Sunday
Or an ice-cold beer at a college football game
I don't know why at eighteen, mama gave me a curfew
But it was, ""Son, you're under my roof, then you're under my rules""

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess it's all a part of a bigger plan
But some of them I'll never understand

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Verse 2]
I don't know why them uptown guys sittin' three seats from me
Are raisin' 'em up just as fast as they can put 'em down
Or why that old timer wants the Yankees on the TV
And the barkeep keeps buyin' that one girl free rounds

[Chorus]
But they got their reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life when you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Bridge]
Some are good and some are bad
Some are true and some are sad
Everyone's got some but I need one
That brings you back

[Chorus]
We all got our reasons, just like you
When you walked out of my life and you didn't have to
You send me reelin', there's nothin' I can do
About you takin' my heart and breakin' it right in two
So if you see me soakin' in these thoughts I'm thinkin'
Drownin' in some barroom off the deep end
I got my reasons

[Outro]
Woah, I got my reasons
Yeah, I got my reasons

Every Little Bit Helps,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
This futon I crashed on in college, well, it ain't our bed
But  at least it don't smell like you
Patron  up on the counter, well, it ain't your red
And them long stems are long gone, too
Put that record on, took your pictures off the shelf
Oh,  'cause every little bit helps

[Chorus]
Might  not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin'  right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One  night in to your ""goodbye, gone"" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps

[Verse 2]
And this fiver might only spin my tires to the other side of town
But at least I'm out of this house
And this dive's tired, the band, man, it ain’t my sound
But at least they're playin' it loud
Two beers in and I'll be long gone come 12
Oh, 'cause every little bit helps

[Chorus]
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night in to your ""goodbye, gone"" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps

[Bridge]
Every sip, every drink
That girl and her wink
It ain't much but I think
That every little bit helps

[Chorus]
Might not get me all the way over you
But every little bit gets me a little bit closer to
Walkin' right out of your valley of the shadow of death
Step by step, I'm gettin'
Out from under that spell you put on me
I know you just left and I know I might only be
One night in to your ""goodbye, gone"" kinda hell
Oh, but every little bit helps
Oh, yeah, every little bit helps

Dear Today,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
Dear Today, Tomorrow here
Man, I was just checkin' in, hope you've been well
Me? I'm doin' alright, could always be better
Seein' as your the only one with a choice in the matter
If I know you, hell, you're too busy
To do damn near anything that you ought to
Guess what I'm sayin' is, is if you don't change
Boy, you'll be kickin' yourself one of these days

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Listen, I ain't tryin' to bring you down
'Cause I know damn better than pushin' you around
I guess I was just lookin' out for you and me both
'Cause we both lose if I told you so

[Chorus]
So maybe you should call our mama and have a drink with our old man
Quit wastin' our sweet time and put that diamond on her hand
Stop takin' me for granted like I'll always be around
'Cause even as you read this, boy, that clock is tickin' down
And remember every second I got's borrowed
So I hope you think of me today
Sincerely, Tomorrow

What You See Is What You Get,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I'm a puzzle
I'm a walking contradiction
And far from mint condition
'Cause there's pieces I can't find
Sometimes trouble
A can of Cope a day addiction
With set in stone convictions
And a no bend bottom line

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm an easy read but I ain't no open book
Got a knack for making things harder than they look

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""

[Verse 2]
At least I'm honest
I don't spin it like a record
And I ain't acting like I'm better
Than you know I really am
Yeah, you're dead on it
You got me figured, I'll admit it
Set in my ways hard-headed
But hell, I do the best I can

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
""What you see is what you get""

[Bridge]
With me ain't no tricks up these sleeves
An acquired taste, a constant work in progress

[Chorus]
I'm a straight shootin'
Beer drinkin', rule breakin'
Don't think I won't take a good thing too far
I'm a midnightin', backslidin'
Getaway car drivin'
Runnin' away with your heart
I guess be careful what you wish for is all I meant when I said
What you see is what you get
What you see is what you get

Does To Me (feat. Eric Church),Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1: Luke Combs]
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Verse 2: Luke Combs]
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said ""I do"" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Bridge: Eric Church]
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Chorus: Luke Combs & Eric Church]
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me

[Outro: Eric Church]
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

Angels Workin' Overtime,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I'm a 50 hour paycheck
Ain't slept a damn wink
Moth to a neon light
I'm a 9 to 5, 10 to 2
Shower in between the two
Let it ride kinda guy
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime

[Chorus]
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
My Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
""Son, how the hell you get by?""
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime

[Verse 2]
I got some barstool best friends
Little off the deep end
That's my kinda crowd
A little rough around the edges
Get a little reckless
Might get a little too loud
But we'll be fine
With our angels workin' overtime

[Chorus]
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
Yeah, my Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
""Son, how the hell you get by?""
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Come on

[Bridge]
Ooh, Gary sounds good on that steel
Come on, come on, Ben

[Chorus]
Punchin' that time clock
Wearin' them wings off
Wishin' I was someone else
Ridin' 'round crazy
Just tryin' to save me
Is puttin' 'em straight through hell
Yeah, my Mama's been praying
Daddy's been saying
""Son, how the hell you get by?""
'Cause I got my
Angels workin' overtime
Oh, I got my
Angels workin' overtime

[Outro]
Time to clock in, boys
Come on
Angels workin' overtime

All Over Again,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
Feels so familiar
You walking in here
Wearing just what you know makes me weak
And I'm already ordering you a drink
Baby, and then we're
Gonna get out of here
Just like the last time and the time before
We're at your house and through the door

[Chorus]
And we're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn ""I love you""
Into ""Boy, where you been?""
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

[Verse 2]
I'll think you're out of my system
At least 'til I miss ya
I'll start going through withdrawals
That's about the time you'll call

[Chorus]
And we'll be falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn ""I love you""
Into ""Boy, where you been?""
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

[Bridge]
Well, I know where we'll wind up
'Cause trouble loves to find us
And I guess goodbye's just too tough
'Cause last time was the last time, but

[Chorus]
We're falling all over again
Like a flashback to way back when
Back when we were us
Couldn't get enough
But we both know how this ends
You can leave it up to me
To say things that I don't mean
And I'll leave it up to you
To turn ""I love you""
Into ""Boy, where you been?""
And just like that
Just as fast as we began
We're all over again

[Outro]
Oh, we're all over again
Well, I know where we'll wind up
And I guess goodbye's just too tough

Nothing Like You,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
I'm on this red-eye rolling down a runway
Window seat, nonstop one-way
2 PM, Gate B10, it can't come soon enough
I've got a mid-flight magazine and a mixed drink
I wish time would fly right with me
Damn the days that baggage claim's in another taxi town
But they always bring me back to you

[Chorus]
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you

[Verse 2]
I've spent every mile missing you, baby
It's enough to drive me crazy
""I love you""'s from hotel rooms
They sure do make it tough
But they always bring me back to you

[Chorus]
I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like, nothing like you

[Bridge]
In all these nothing towns
You in this whole world around
You're the only place I wanna get back to

[Chorus]
'Cause I've seen California and the fields of Oklahoma
From thirty thousand feet, can't beat the view
Crossed the Mississippi, watched the mountains over Tennessee
Become a Carolina sky that was so blue
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
And still ain't seen nothing like
Nothing like you
Nothing like you

Better Together,Luke Combs,"

[Verse 1]
A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Verse 2]
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, ""I love you, too"" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

[Chorus]
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

[Bridge]
Sometimes we're oil and water, but I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest, your first and my last name

[Chorus]
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

Everyday Life,Coldplay,"

[Verse 1]
What in the world are we going to do?
Look at what everybody's going through
What kind of world do you want it to be?
Am I the future or the history?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone tells each other all kinds of lies
Everyone falls, everybody dreams and doubts
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out

[Verse 2]
How in the world am I going to see
You as my brother, not my enemy?

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone hurts, everyone cries
Everyone sees the colour in each other's eyes
Everyone loves, everybody gets their hearts ripped out
Got to keep dancing when the lights go out
Gonna keep dancing when the lights go out
Hold tight for everyday life
Hold tight for everyday life

At first light, throw my arms out, open wide
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelu-halle-hallelujah

Almond and peach trees in bloom
And he would know just when and what to sow
So golden and opportune

Tulips the colour of honey today

Baby no accomplice, every man for himself
Tryna get my money, yeah, I'm really 'bout my wealth
Pull up swingin' on me, can't you see I'm black belt
Wonder why I be the only rapper 'bout my health
If I'm not grinding, might as well put me in hell
Labels chasing me 'cause I deactivated stealth
Fuckin' hated school, I was saved by the bell
Ain't so different from you, yeah, why can't you tell?

[Refrain]
Cash in, cash out, consider it dealt
Do this for myself, I ain't do it for the clout
Never copy lanes, yeah, I took another route
Always cause 'grains, never shared a bit of doubt

[Verse 2]
Fill my cup, and I watch you talk shit
Never been an opp, and I've never been a bitch
Be my guest, go burn your own bridge
'Course I'm cold enough, don't need a new fridge
Seems like every song you drop is a miss
Drip too much, yeah, hydrolysis
Really 'bout the cheese, yeah, Armenian Swiss
Get my mom a brand new whip, I'm proud of the gift
Pink-yellow piece of plastic, all up on my hip
Twelve years later, you gon' show me to the kids
Know my music timeless, I don't even need to risk
Once I'm super rich I'll post with diamonds on the bed
I'm always with the flu cause I'm ready with the shits
Every song I drop, rare like it's deadstock
Thot girls always putting me in an airlock
Finally got some property, cop the boardwalk
Big shows, internationally, even Bangkok
Pop back from China with a big bag
Got some money but I still check the price tag
Numbers moving slow, so you'll have to blame lag
Seven-hundred can't Spotify this everyday
Nerf strap, cock back, with a red dot
Won't cap, drawn back, hear a gunshot
Won't relax, no slack, hit the jackpot
Posted at the top, why your bitch be mad, Scott?

Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts
I gotta make sure, they don't break me
Bad thoughts, all I got is bad thoughts

The constant lack of confidence would take more than a toll
Time and time again, it is so painful

[Verse 2]
Why does making money make me feel so sad (Feel so sad)
Everybody round me always acting so crass (Acting so crass)
I hope my future past won't be a blur
Do not remind me of something we were

thousand eyes,FKA twigs,"

If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes
If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes
If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes

home with you,FKA twigs,"

[Verse 1]
I'm so wired, fought it, seen it, tried it
I die for you on my terms
When I get my lessons learned
Apples, cherries, pain
Breathe in, breathe out, pain
No, no, Novocaine
Still maintain my grace

[Pre-Chorus]
How come the more you have, the more that people want from you?
The more you burn away, the more the people earn from you
The more you pull away, the more that they depend on you
I've never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
So I wonder if your needs are even meant for me
I wonder if you think that I could never raise you up
I wonder if you think that I could never help you fly
Never seen a hero like me in a sci-fi
But I'd save a life if I thought it belonged to you
Mary Magdalene would never let her loved ones down

[Chorus]
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be home with you
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be running down the hills to you

[Verse 2]
When I visualize, all I see is black (Onyx)
Ground me to the floor, just a little more (Get it, onyx)
I know I've been gone, you've been all alone
Stoking up the fire for you
Set the place alight, call me late at night
And I'll be running home to you

[Chorus]
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be home with you
I didn't know that you were lonely
If you'd have just told me, I'd be running down the hills to be with you
If you had told me, I'd be running down the hills to be with you
I'd be running down the hills to be with you
And I'd have told you I was lonely too

Everything is just the same as before
You are turning 'round and 'round
You see, it's a sad day for sure

Taste the fruit of me
Make love to all you see

Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

Take a chance on all the things you can't see
Make a wish on all that lives within thee
If you're foolishly in love with me
It's a fine day for sure

Taste the fruit of me
Make love to all you see

[Chorus]
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

You're running
And I tried to make it work before
You're running
I made you sad before
I, then I
Have you ever made a wish before?
I see you running
I made you sad before

[Verse 3]
I can imagine a world when my arms are embraced around you
I lie naked and pure with intentions to cleanse you and take you
The city howls with a cry to seduce you and claim you
So it's time
And it's a sad day for sure

[Chorus]
Would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?
Ah, would you make a, make a, make a wish on my love?

And you're running
Have you ever made a wish before?

Next to me, kiss my cheek, 'cause it's early days
Day three, take me to a deep river
Steal a kiss when I'm lost in the mist

Will you still be there for me, once I'm yours to obtain?
Once my fruits are for taking and you flow through my veins?
Do you still think I'm beautiful, when my tears fall like rain?
My love is so bountiful for a man who is true to me

For a man who can follow his heart
Not get bound by his boys and his chains

And stand up in my holy terrain (I try, I try, I try, I try for you)

Hot pink when you open up my sweet thighs
Pull you in, and your life can begin, 'cause it's early days

But will you still be there for me, now I'm yours to obtain?
Now my fruits are for taking and your fingers are stained
Do you still think I'm beautiful, when you light me in flames?
My love is so bountiful

For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry)
Not get bound by his boys and his chains (I try, I try, I try for you)
For a man who can follow his heart (I cry, I cry, I cry, I cry)
And stand up in my holy terrain (I try, I try, I try, I try for you)

Throw loads of gold on you just to fall asleep, yeah
I hope you never take my love, yeah, in vain, yeah
Through the thunder, through the window, I see rain (I see rain)
Water the garden, play with snakes in Balmain (Oh yeah)
Makin' you fall apart, watch me drown in my pain (My pain)

A woman's touch
A sacred geometry

No sleeper seats, that's a mattress
No sleeper seats, that's a mattress (Sleep)
You ain't stingy, split your tablets with me
You won't flinch when camera's flashing, flashing
Not fake laid back, no, it's natural
And I think you made for the life I lead
I'm not fake patient, I don't fake sick, huh
That kinda coffin don't need lean
Rest in peace
Got this lust for life in me, yeah
Horny for the game, uh
First they kiss, then they bite soft, uh
Then that bitch wanna play it off, huh
Fuck it, I'm pretty still in a pit of snakes
While serpents shake some brand new scales
I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos
Acting familiar, took all the rock
And turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
And he ungrateful, they don't say thank you
They don't say grace, not even for meals, not even for millions
Fuck it, I'm pretty still, look at my deal
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Pretty still, it ain't no pretty pill
It's either real or real
Real easy on the eyes, green like a soccer field
Skin hot when they tried me like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel
Rocket

[Bridge]
Quit being violent with me (Yeah, why? Why?)
Quit being violent with me
Quit being violent with me
You make me violent

[Outro]
My room, my room, my room with me
Every night you were in my room
My room, my room with me
I guess I can't state my feelings too soon
I don't know you
And I can't put no threats in the air

Under the Graveyard,Ozzy Osbourne,"

[Verse 1]
Today, I woke up and I hate myself
Death doesn't answer when I cry for help
No high could save me from the depths of Hell
I'll drown my mind until I'm someone else

Doubt take care of me, be scared of me
My misery owns me
I don't wanna be my enemy

Cover my eyes so I can't see clear
One sip away from everything I fear
Ashes to ashes, watch me disappear
Closer to home because the end is near

My misery owns me
I don't wanna be my enemy
My misery owns me now

Please don't break my heart, trust me, I've been broken before

[Verse 1]
I've been broken, yeah, I know how it feels

I'm still hurting, yeah, I'm hurting inside

[Chorus]
It's you, it's always you
If I'm ever gonna fall in love, I know it's gon' be you

Oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I bought you things that I didn't even have the money for
If I could make you feel so rich, I don't mind feelin' poor
There's something 'bout you so addictive, had me needing more
Yeah, I just wanna hold you, baby, you the one I want
I know I've said this all before, but I'll say it again
You're the only one I want, and, girl, I can't pretend
I remember cloudy days, we cuddled in my bed
The thought of losing you just makes no sense inside my head

[Chorus]
You're the reason I believe that love is real
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me, is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' want, no, no, no

[Bridge]
I can't love nobody anymore
You're the only one that I ever want
I compare her to you, she has never won
Now I wanna just be all alone
Nobody love me like you
And I can't love nobody back
You remind me of the moon
'Cause every night, you're coming back
What am I supposed to do?
If I'm so in love with you
I cannot get over you
I cannot get over you

[Verse 2]
Since you left me, every night I go stare at the moon
Wishing it was you and I, that's something we would do
Every Sunday morning I go watch the flowers bloom
I do things we used to do, hoping I'll run into you
What's a lie, and what's the truth?
I cannot get over you
Doesn't matter what I do
Everyone just looks like you
Girl, I smell you everywhere
Smell your perfume and your hair
I try to act like I don't care
Everyone knows (That I care)

[Chorus]
You're the reason I believe that love is real (Love is real)
Ain't nobody make me feel the way you make me feel
Darling, tell me, is it real?
Or was I lying to myself just to make it feel so real?

[Post-Chorus]
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon', no
Ain't nobody gon' love you like I love you
Ain't nobody gon' trust like I trust you
Ain't nobody gon' want you like I want you
Ain't nobody gon', ain't nobody gon'

Are you askin' me to move on?
Are you askin' me to forget?

How Things Used to Be,Ali Gatie,"

[Chorus]
I wonder how you are
I wonder if you think of me
And when I'm all alone
I think of how things used to be
I'm stuck here writing songs
I wonder if they're helping me
The moments when you're gone
To me they feel like eternity

[Verse 1]
The way you make me feel, make you feel so significant
You got me right in the mind, you searchin' for synonyms
The feelings that I got for you cannot get rid of them
What you gon' say I'm gon' trust it, don't need no evidence
When I be feelin' so sick you be like my medicine
The way we got, our connection it feel so effortless
The way we talkin', we always talkin' so intimate
And that's the reason I know our love is Heaven sent

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been wonderin'
I've been thinkin', are you thinkin' of me?

[Chorus]
I wonder how you are
I wonder if you think of me

To me they feel like eternity

Tell me what you need, you know I got it right now
I'ma treat you right, yeah I would never treat you wrong

I've been thinkin', are you thinkin' of me?

[Chorus]
I wonder how you are

I'm stuck here writing songs
I wonder if they're helping me

Holding On,Ali Gatie,"

[Verse 1]
Don't give up so easy, we could work it out
I don't wanna let you be a part of my past
Way before I came up you was holdin' me down
I'll always put you first, just to make sure we last
I don't wanna fight about the things that we did
I don't wanna argue like we used to (Used to)
I'm wonderin' why you just can't forget and forgive
Just let me hold you down like I used to (Like I used to)

[Chorus]
I keep holding on
I can't lose you, I won't give up
The nights are feelin' long
I'm losin' sleep dreaming 'bout us
And after all we've done
Don't you dare walk out on me
'Cause I keep holding on
This can't be a memory

[Verse 2]
In the past I know I lied to you
I won't blame it on my ignorance
Now I'd rather that you know the truth
I know for us it's worth it in the end
We askin' questions like an interview
Always talkin', never listenin'
I made mistakes but, baby, so did you
We only did it out of innocence

[Chorus]
I keep holding on
I can't lose you, I won't give up
The nights are feelin' long
I'm losin' sleep dreaming 'bout us
And after all we've done
Don't you dare walk out on me
'Cause I keep holding on
This can't be a memory

Lost My Lover,Ali Gatie,"

[Intro]
Sometimes, people start movin' different
And they start, feeling different things
I, but this is how I'm feeling right now, yeah

[Chorus]
When you told me that you love me, was it something that you meant?
When I told you that I loved you, that's the only thing I felt
Told you, ""I would take a bullet for you"", but then you still left
Never had to take that bullet, but you was leavin' felt like death
Lost my lover, lost my friend
Lost my start and lost my end
I'm not fine, but I'll pretend
You're my what, how, why and when
I still wonder how you are
You're so close but you're still far
I can't get to you by car
'Cause you live inside my heart
You're my sunshine, you're my storm
With you is where I belong
You feel safe, you are my home
Always been my comfort zone
And now I live all alone

[Verse]
I think about you daily
From the sunrise to the sunset
I watch the water move
Rememberin' days you used to move me
There's something bliss about lovin' you
Like I was born to fall for you
Like I was born to be hurt by your words
You never meant to say, your words are poison
I sip on your lies, like it's my favorite drink
It's like being addicted to something that's killin' you
But, baby, I'm feelin' you
You're Heaven and Hell
The warmest Summer and coldest Winter
The sweetest soul with a heart so bitter, it never made sense to me
You taught me love and heartbreak
How to gain love and then lose it (Lose it)
How to feel love and abuse it (Abuse it)
Love is a drug I'm usin' (I'm usin')
You're my worst nightmare and favorite dream
But isn't it ironic the one I dream about's the reason I can't sleep?
Isn't it ironic the one I dream about's the reason I can't sleep?
Tell me isn't it ironic the one I dream about's the reason I can't sleep? (Yeah)

[Chorus]
When you told me that you love me, was it something that you meant?
When I told you that I loved you, that's the only thing I felt
Told you, ""I would take a bullet for you"", but then you still left
Never had to take that bullet, but you was leavin' felt like death
Lost my lover, lost my friend
Lost my start and lost my end
I'm not fine but I'll pretend
You're my what, how, why and when
I still wonder how you are
You're so close but you're still far
I can't get to you by car
'Cause you live inside my heart
You're my sunshine, you're my storm
With you is where I belong
You feel safe, you are my home
Always been my comfort zone
And now I live all alone

I said
""Isn't it ironic the one I dream about's the reason I can't sleep?""
Isn't it ironic the one I dream about's the reason I can't sleep?

Woah,Lil Baby,"

[Intro]
New car very noisy
Come through and it's roarin'
Yeah, yeah
You know how I'm coming
You know how I'm coming

[Verse 1]
Bend her over, then I murk her
Call Gunna if you want you a Birkin
""Oh, Baby, you be lyin' in your verses
I be hearin', say you buyin' 'em purses""
I can't even lie, you ain't my type
You ain't even all that fine in person
I can guarantee you if you my kind
She got every bag you can imagine
Big house, I can really be braggin'
Hundred thousand in my mouth like, ""What's happenin'?""
Not the big cheap teeth, that's embarrasin'
He ain't me, you can keep the comparisons
My bitch probably one of the baddest
Good girl, turned her into a savage
Dispatch, got a problem in traffic
We came through in matching G-Wagens
Low-key, I've been keeping it classy
Could be really out here doin' 'em nasty
Niggas couldn't even see me in last year
Just started and them niggas in last gear
I ain't even try to and I passed 'em
Giving looks, I contribute to fashion
Drop a song, I be giving them captions
Stand alone, not your regular rapper

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, woah (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
I put the dope in the back of the car and I tell 'em to go
She hit when she land, she bring me the bands, she back on the road
She know how I get when I get in that mode
Ain't fuckin' with bitches, ain't buying no clothes
Wanna do shows and make me some songs
Make sure that other shit come in, get sold
We fuck with the strippers 'cause we play with poles
We play with our money and not with our nose
I used to go to the West to get loads
I just came back from the West with a trophy
I'm on some more shit
She said she miss it and sendin' emojis
No time to kick it, I'm always in motion
Can't say I miss you, I don't got emotions
I'm on that back-when-I slept-on-the-floor shit
I'm on that me-and-the-bro-kick-a-door shit
I'm on that back-when-I-stood-at-the-stove shit
Ain't goin' broke, I'm just back on my old shit
I'm takin' drugs, I don't know how to cope it
I know one thing, I'm never gon' be hopeless
If you tell 'em what was said, you a rodent
Drive the new Corvette like it's stolen, yeah

[Chorus]
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, woah
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, woah
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, woah
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, woah
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' (Skrrt)

Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious

And how them umbrellas coming out of locked doors?
How the front doors open up like the back doors?

You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on the beach sittin' up""
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us

Might have started off rocky
And ruined our first date
But last night
When you finally called me
I ran straight through the lobby

Should I have known that you would take hold and never let go?
Never let go

Did you say that you got nothing else to do?
Is it okay if I stay? 'Cause I'm dying to
Yeah, I'm dying to

Three weeks now, we've been so caught up
Better if we do this on our own

Call You Mine,The Chainsmokers,"

[Verse 1]
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Who's gonna save us now?
When we thought that we couldn't get higher
Things started looking down
I look at you and you look at me
Like nothing but strangers now
Two kids with their hearts on fire
Don't let it burn us out

[Pre-Chorus]
Think about what you believe in now
Am I someone you cannot live without?
'Cause I know I don't wanna live without you, yeah
Come on, let's turn this all around
Bring it all back to that bar downtown
When you wouldn't let me walk out on you, yeah

[Chorus]
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ah, ooh)
Can I call you mine? (Ooh)
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""

[Verse 2]
Broke kids running through the city
Drunk on the subway train
Set free every time you kissed me
We couldn't feel no pain
You looked at me and I looked at you
Like we'd never look away
Broke kids running through the city
Don't let the memory fade

[Chorus]
You said, ""Hey, whatcha doing for the rest of your life?""
And I said, ""I don't even know what I'm doing tonight""
Went from one conversation to your lips on mine
And you said, ""I never regretted the day that I called you mine""
So I call you mine

Kills You Slowly,The Chainsmokers,"

[Verse 1]
Made plans with me and all your friends
I'm late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you're tired of me
I know you wouldn't take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked 'em up
You know that they're my favorite

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Verse 2]
Arguments that never end
You're talkin' shit to spice up conversation
I'm so sick of back and forth
These fights with you are startin' to feel contagious
Said that I'm no good for you
Right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again
And grab my hand even though you hate it

[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we're good again
I do things I can't defend
And even when you hold it in

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions, hidden when we're in the open
Keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't
Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't

[Bridge]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
And keep on smilin' until it's over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly

[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Explosions hidden when we're in the open
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Keep on smilin' until it's over
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)
Holdin' even though it kills you slowly
(Oh, but, but it, it won't, but I said
You hold on, hopin' it gon' stop, but it don't)

They Wanna Kill You,Dave East,"

[Intro]
Who she like, Lee?
She like Freaky
Freaky Leeky? Freaky Leeky
That's what I do, fuck bitches
And bust niggas in 2K9
And on the court
Real rap, real, the fuck?
On some real shit, jack
You be lovin' these bitches though, jack
You was lovin' her
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Survival of the, survival of the fit, fit, fit
Only the strong, strong, strong, strong, strong survive
And the people look at David and said, ""We wanna kill you, David""
You probably thought the label was gon' shelf me (Because it's because of you)
You prayed that this paper never helped me
That we're in this position that we're in, huh (Tuh)

[Verse]
You probably thought the label was gon' shelf me
You prayed that this paper never helped me
Posted up by the mailbox without a mail key
Exotic weed a creed if you ever smelled me
I don't wanna die young, I wanna die wealthy
Niggas askin' for the most help ain't never helped me
Blue or brown flag in it
You think I'm gettin' to it? Well, that's accurate
Acura slidin', ain't have no passengers
Bubble Goose, wasn't no computers, when it's trouble, shoot
Money made my dick hard, honestly, fell in love with loot
Mathematics supreme, knowledge and wisdom
Understandin' culture, know power'll get you killed, son
(We wanna kill you, David)
Equality God, bill of the strong that y'all
Born in the cypher, shit get tighter than Wonderbras
I come from the slums, had to walk when we wanted cars
Couldn't afford the shit that y'all wearin', that made me wanna rob
That pressure get applied, you know your son involved
You so nervous, phone in your pocket, don't wanna call
Feds is lurkin', I know they watchin', I wanna ball
Plug fronted fifty, I'm starvin', I need a hundred more
Drop it in the pot, cannonball, somersault
September to April, we pumpin', take the summer off
May, June, July, August, livin' lawless
In Georgetown, I really was recruited by the Hoyas
Maneuver through the borders
My man from Cuba, I told him that you could get deported
What if Tookie could've saw this?
No bakery, we was cuttin' cookies by the quarter
Nigga ratted in New York, picked up and took his shit to Florida

[Outro]
And the people look at David and said, ""We wanna kill you, David""
Because it's because of you
That we're in this position that we're in, huh
When God gave them victories in battles, victories over war
Nobody had anything to say negative with David, huh
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Survival of the fit, only the strong, strong survive

Curtains wide open, let the sun shine
You know I gotta fuck you like this sometimes
She was walkin' 'round naked lookin' just like breakfast, shit
I can make it quick, that's enough time (Oh yeah)
How you so fly, you ain't been outside yet?
All the way up with that penthouse mindset
Ain't no realer state than that real estate
Everything else is in the way
By the time the smoke clears, guaranteed I hear her say

This view is everything (Oh yeah)
Shit, I could get used to this

It's lobster, steak, and shrimp now (Woo)
They caught my man on camera
Told him stand up, we don't sit down
Roaches when we was kids
Now it's chauffeurs, my niggas men now (Skkrt)
Readin' letters by the ocean
Trav told me don't put that pen down (Keep writin', nigga)

[Chorus: J Black & Dave East]
This view is everything (Oh yeah)

[Verse 3: Dave East]
Just another nigga from the street, Louies on my feet
Up all night, it been like this for weeks (All night), we don't never sleep
Told my homie, ""Let's go hit the road"" (We out), he back on parole
He told me he gotta keep it solid, them other niggas told
Sixty floors up, you need a key (We up), we can't see police
Shooter's on the roof, any funny moves and he gon' squeeze (Boom)
Elevator, just press penthouse, it'll bring you right to me (PH)
The best flight you ever smoked in your life (All Money In), put you right to sleep

[Verse 4: J Black]
Just another nigga from the streets, we gettin' paid at least (Ayy)
Told them hatin' niggas wait and see, elevator, please (What's up?)

Godfather 4,Dave East,"

[Intro: Nas]
Chicago, you're still shootin' up
And Boston, y'all still shootin' up (Yeah)
And Queensbridge stay shootin' up
Even in Wichita, it's wicked, y'all

[Verse 1: Nas]
You see a mic stand lit up under the spotlight
A silhouette of a man slayin' beats that knock right
I treasure whenever niggas or rhetoricals hit
Orchestral tracks and nail it, smooth black velvet
And rap intelligent, but then it's just a low percent
Who blow on some Nas, B.I.G., and Hova shit
No offense but I was over with findin' young spitters whose names I remember
Dave, Jay Rozay
Dissin' your idols kill your future 'less your idol souped up
Jamaica Ave Nas, cherry drop, couped up
Still hittin' clubs grimy niggas occasionally shoot up
Bang-bang, pow-pow, these snorters still toot up
My dead granddad came to my cousin through a psychic
I don't really like it, pay prices for afterlife advice gets
Kinda double jumbled, prefer to take my chances
Who gets out alive? Nobody got the answers
All we got is questions
I told my bitch she hit the genetic lottery
Love it when she lie to me
A friendship is built over time and trust too
But trust is a contract that constantly needs to be renewed
For peace and solitude
Peace and solitude, p-p-p-peace and solitude
Trust me and love me, I trust you and love you
Could you, could you, could you really show love?
Like a tree fallin' in the middle of the forest
Nobody heard your shit drop, it's really garbage
How come rappers you claimin' I got my style from
Never pile one-tenth of my mint?
No diss to them, men who got it in, this is now, that was then
Different style, different Benz, it's clear there's a difference
You resortin' to, uh, distortin' the truth
Grindin', my offspring needs juice, walk in my shoes

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Yo, big bro, I'm from the ice pick era, light-skinned terror
Thought I could sell this dope until my life get better
Hieroglyphics, got 'em tatted on us, so it's hard to miss us
Reminiscin' my uncle sniffin' the Lionel Richie
Soul Train over breakfast, Lexus across the Triborough
They not thorough, how you my brother? You not Errol

[Verse 3: Nas]
Soul Train over breakfast, Lexus across the Triborough
You not thorough, you not my brother, you not Jungle
A whisper of death, a kiss of life
From Sade lips, my wish for life
My neck wearin' exotic material, so excited I'm still here with you
I cried about it with a sinister smile
What's notable, I been winnin' awhile, I'm a dazzler
Ancient astronaut from the Dogon Tribe, gangster tatted up
Time travelin' Nas, how I'm unravelin' this major paper
And blast niggas like a Navy laser?
System activated, board the cabin, orderly fashion
I'm glad you made it, I'm the captain, flight time, three minutes
Won't be servin' lunch or dinner
Your comfort is my concern, you could burn it if you feel it
We'll be cruisin' at forty thousand feet
Your in-flight movie is Godfather 4 starrin' me and Dave East

[Verse 4: Dave East]
First class for the whole flight, go 'head and lean your seat back
No lunch or dinner menu, but got champagne if you drink that
Stewardesses models, gelato, you could bring it on
The pilot cool, I snuck in the cabin so I could see the storm
Joe Clark, the one that they leanin' on
I just took my shoes off, shorty across the aisle look like Lena Horne
Forty thousand feet, my wifi still crackin'
You niggas is still packin', this flight about to land
Pick your seat up, secure your area, clean up your mess
Half the seats Louis Vuitton, we double G'd up the rest
We don't even acknowledge the ones you seem to impress
Don't forget your charger, we could fly whenever, be my guest

Dave's with me through my mother's situation (Yeah, I was)
But he's still playin' basketball, he's doing his thing (Yeah, I was)
Two years later, he gives me a call
He's hit rock bottom (Yeah, I did)
He's gettin' kicked out of school
He has another dream: to rap
He tells me he needs to come back to New York
And if he has this opportunity, he's gonna make it
I knew I was already strugglin', I didn't even want him to come back
And be in the streets, I didn't want him to get into any bullshit
We didn't really have much, na'mean? We were just together
All we had was each other and his dream
I look back now, I think of 6E, that front door (Pals)
Right by the staircase, perfect place, that back room I grew up in
He's been such an inspiration to so many
People see the grind and the pain, the struggle he's gone through (Right)
That we've been through (Right)
But this is for everybody out there (Yeah, it is)
Lookin', thinkin', dreamin', everybody needs a sign (Yeah, they do)
Sometimes you can't see it yourself
You need a sign, need some help

[Verse 1: Dave East]
We know we guilty but we gon' act like we innocent (On God)
My Glock was filthy, need disinfectant to get it in (Oh, God)
My grandpops was an immigrant, never a citizen (Never)
They expect me to vote, told my mother, I needed Ritalin (Crazy)
Was born crazy, (Lost) I never felt like I was normal (Never)
The sun shine bright after it rain, that's what the storm do (Right)
Roll a blunt and wish I could trade places with Freaky (Malik)
Until I sit and realize my daughter really need me (On God)
I had to cut ties with my closest, niggas is greedy (Greedy)
You can see the pain in my eyes as soon as you see me (Look)
Aladdin had me tryna make wishes, wasn't no genies (None)
Halal if I was talkin' bout lambs, no Lamborghinis (None)
We was really starvin', in my aunty crib hearin' Marvin
Had to travel the world to realize nowhere like Harlem (Nowhere)
I tried to keep my distance from niggas that's scared of problems (Scared)
Them niggas realize you food, then anywhere, they'll rob him (Anywhere)
You ever tuck in your jewelry? Then you don't need to shine (You don't need it)
All the money in the world won't bring you peace of mind (Nope)
All them chains don't matter, they hate to see you shine
Was lost, prayin' to God, beggin' him, like, ""I need a sign"" (I need one)
Show me how to do it when ain't nothin' workin' (Workin')
I just hope that I don't shoot if we meet up in person (God)
Now they ask my feature price, they never wanted verses (God)
Now I live a different life, can't see my mother workin' (On God)
Should I rob 'em? Should I shoot 'em? I just need a sign (I need one)
You know I've been goin' through it, just give me a sign (Don't blow it)
I promise we all could do it, I just need some time (I promise)
Should I continue with this music? Just give me a sign (Tell)
Thinkin' 'bout the day when I won't need to rhyme
She tryna lie on me or she love me? I just need a sign (I needed one)
I close my eyes and pray, like, ""I just need a sign"" (Pray)
I listen to what you tell me, I can't read your mind

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I need a sign, I need to blind 'em, eh
Before the diamonds
Though I've been live, I set my timin', eh
Ain't no silver lining
They can't control me, fuck your controllers
Lost in the sofa least every mornin'
I'm takin' over, fuck these emotions, all the signs
Hey, niggas callin' like we homies now, not
I bet they stop with all that trollin' now, blocked
Made that rooftop into a floor for now, it's a sign
Now it's Rolls when we rollin' out, drop
Fuck a lease, I gotta buy the block, block
Fuck them people, there's a bottom line, no need to sign

[Verse 2: Dave East]
My man died before we talked, ain't get to speak in time
Them grams had them smokers lookin' like a sneaker line
My little man don't wanna rumble, so he keep a 9
Not breakin' it down, keepin' this pot, shit, this peace of mind
I'm on my daughter, across the water, I hope she don't see no crime
There's problems, I pull up on the bike, I'm on Deebo time
I tried to ask my father to help me, told me, ""I need to grind""
Your funeral packed, but you dead, can't even see the line
I hope I see the signs
It break your heart when a youngin' dyin', he was nine
They say he stop, but we speedin', so we don't see the sign
Feel like a war goin' on when all your people dyin'
Niggas is numb and they gon' act like they don't see you cryin'
You got a chance to get outta here, we don't need you ridin'
He just need a sign (He just need a sign)
Nobody keep it real with him, he tired of people lyin'
He sick of lightin' up candles, too many people dyin'
Knowin' you might get up out the hood, that shit'll keep you tryin'
I'm used to the jungle, nigga, I been a lion
Walk in the booth, kill everything, even my pen is dyin'
That shit they tried to teach in school, we ain't consider science
You a sucker if you give up, too many niggas tryin'
Pocket watchin', you focused on what your nigga buyin'
Pocket watchin', you focused on what your nigga buyin'

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
I need a sign, I need to blind 'em, eh
Before the diamonds
Though I've been live, I set my timing, eh
Ain't no silver lining
They can't control me, fuck your controllers
Lost in the sofa least every morning
I'm takin' over, fuck these emotions, all the signs
Hey, niggas callin' like we homies now, not
I bet they stop with all that trollin' now, blocked
Made that rooftop into a floor for now, it's a sign
Now it's Rolls when we rollin' out, drop
Fuck a lease, I gotta buy the block, block
Fuck them people, there's a bottom line, no need to sign, yeah, yeah

On My Way 2 School,Dave East,"

[Intro]
Alright, let's get up
6:30 in the morning (Oh my God), you got 15 minutes to eat breakfast (Alright, alright, alright)
Wake your ass up, Earl and David, right now (Lemme get five more minutes Ma, please)
No five minutes, nothin', get up (Oh, God, Earl, get up bro, get up my nigga)
I'm gon' get your father (Chill, chill, chill, chill)
He know how to get y'all up (It's too early for all that, Earl, get up, just get up my nigga)
Five minutes ain't gon' make ya or break ya, get your ass up right now

[Verse]
My mother kissed me on my forehead on my way to school (Yes she did)
Told me to look out for my brother on our way to school (I got him)
Walkin' passed the niggas that hustle, they told me stay in school
I probably would've fell in love with it if they would've made it cool (Right)
I would see Bloods, Crips, and Kings on my way to school (What up?)
Makin' sure my outfit was mean, always was late to school (Always)
Report cards kept me in trouble, that shit'll break your mood
I was just in homeroom with him, this nigga made the news?
Fightin', givin' different addresses, they made me change up schools
Walkin' through the halls next to my opps, that was a dangerous move
Nice in ball, all the girls liked me, guess you could say I'm cool
Had love for a few of my teachers, but I just hated school (I hated it)
Either it was that or I just hated rules
I even was cool with the lunch ladies that would make our food (Yeah I was)
Brand new JanSport, the cops stopped me on my way to school
Like, ""Go to class or come with us,"" funny how life'll make you choose

[Chorus]
On my way to school
I seen everything on my way to school
I seen niggas die on my way to school (Die)
Just tryna stay alive on my way to school
On my way to school
You got a whip to drive, they gon' say you cool
Both eyes red, I got high on my way to school
Hope I don't end up dead on my way to school

[Verse 2]
Tried to cut through the projects, got robbed on my way to school
His mom needed help, he got a job, like, why stay in school?
His best friend just dropped out, he had some H to move
You got your pops, he ain't seen his father, he can't relate to you
His cousin pumpin' coke in the lobby and he been watchin' him
His Mama wasn't affordin' them Jordan's, he like, ""I'm coppin' 'em""
His crew said, ""Fuck school,"" he rather go hit the block with them
He tryna get a dollar, his mom made it, ain't no stoppin' him (No)
He fell out with his man, he noticed he been with the opps and them (Opps)
He ain't been to class in three weeks, this nigga wildin'
Heard about the island, that shit sound more excitin' than school
Couldn't give a fuck about a test, he tryna Prada his shoes (Red stripes)

[Chorus]
On my way to school (On my way)
Seen 'em about to raid my buildin' on my way to school
Pack on me, tried to make a killin' on my way to school (Right)
My life might've been different if I'd have stayed in school
On my way to school (On my way)
Nike's and Adidas on my way to school (Either or)
You ever seen a homicide on your way to school? (Boom!)
You never seen your homie Mama cry on your way to school (Never)

[Outro]
Mr. Brewster, you're always in the hallway, get to class
But I ain't goin' to math today, yo I'm bored, I'm failin' that shit anyway
How does detention sound before basketball practice?
I ain't took none of them tests, I ain't do none of the homework, not one of them shits, so ain't no point in even goin'
You got me in this shit mad early in the mornin', I'm doin' good in all my other classes
I'm boutta get up outta here, word
Just keep hanging out in the hallways, Brewster, you'll see, never gonna amount to shit
Never gonna amount to shit
Fuck outta here, man, whatever, man
They ain't teach me shit in here anyway
These teachers is broke, I'm goin' to the NBA
Fuck this school shit
You better hope basketball works, Brewster

"
Seventeen,Dave East,"

[Intro]
Fuck you (Fuck you), fuck you (Fuck you)

[Chorus]
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (Reminiscing)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (As a youngin' and all dat)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen

[Verse 1]
I was breakin' weed down in my basement
Attached to my gang, so I could never leave (Loc gang)
I ain't givin' up no information (Nah)
I been buying shit that I ain't never need
Them beats coming in and out another station
A Mayweather nigga that could never read
Circuit seen the paperwork, so how you on probation? (How?)
I've been living with a curse, I ran out of patience
Jungle got me out the dirt, living life for what it's worth
Nights sleeping in my shirt thinking I won't make it
Now I got your favorite actress in here gettin' naked
Pardon my back, 600 on land, like a shark it's all black
Don't talk 'bout my trap
Moment of silence, don't talk 'bout no violence
My phone might be tapped
I don't condone or know rats
I done showed love when they hated on me (They hated)
Amiri's fit different, got some paper on me (You see it)
I'm smoking out the pack, leaks'll fade embalmed
Chef up in the kitchen, got my apron on
Hatin' ain't gon' help you make it, homie
Take it to the grave, couple things I done seen, people changing on me (Changing on me)
The love change when you find out that ain't your homie (Changed)
The drug game not about to make you famous, homie (No)
I was putting in work when you was sleepin' (Work)
You was gettin' full, I wasn't eatin'
These niggas come around for no reason
The same place we found 'em, we can leave 'em
These shoes don't come out 'til next season
These jewels like I got 'em out the freezer (Cold)
She rude, she don't really have a reason (No)
I move like I'm tryna get a visa

[Chorus]
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (You know them young days, you)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (Tryna figure out where the party at)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (First time hittin' a blunt, shit like that)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (I caught one motherfucker)

[Verse 2]
You couldn't tell me shit when I was seventeen (Nah)
Teachers told me I would never graduate
Cuzzo touching money I had never seen
He told me, put me put my paper and never give my last away
I got up out the hood, some niggas never leave
Remember Friday night, prayin' I wake up on Saturday
Loiter in buildings, no, I'd rather spoil my children
Can't be one of them dads that went that way
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen
Dirty lil' nigga, room was never clean (Right)
I had the cornrows like Bubba Chuck (AI)
Tryna make it to the league on whoever team (Whoever)
Them nightmares started comin' I could never dream
Demons talking to me, God, please intervene
I used to wear my new Jordans 'til the sole was ripped
Girls used to look at me like I was never clean (Dirty lil' nigga)
Moving forward, I ain't bringing up no old shit (Nah)
I got a rental, we could go and take this road trip (We out)
Like a pill, I just want to get in motion
The D's man to man, so we gotta run a motion
Thinkin' back to when I was only seventeen, if I said I'm gon' be rich, you'd have thought that I was joking
My hooride was a Grande Cherokee, free crib with the key, go outside if you smoking (Woah)

[Chorus]
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (I'm talkin' when a nigga used to get)
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen (Get kicked out the crib and shit, every other week)
(You know what I'm saying, your first time tryna squeeze some titties, get some ass or somethin' like that)
Young days, nigga
Thinkin' back when I was only seventeen

Mama I Made It,Dave East,"

[Intro]
I, I wait for the day, a sweet gentle sway
A sweet gentle sway
Okay, y'all gettin' on outta here
David, watch out for your lil' brother, and y'all have a good day
Love y'all
Love you too, Mom
You are now listening to AraabMUZIK
Somebody tell my mama I made it (C'mon)
Mama I made it (C'mon)
Tell my mama I made it (C'mon, c'mon)
Somebody tell my mama I made it (Oh, uh)

[Chorus]
Tell my mama I made it
Copped her a Rollie for the time we never spent (Ma)
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout no rent (Never)
Tell my mama I made it
She used to slap us when we used to try to cuss (Ooh!)
I got sick of seein' you drivin' that bus
Tell my mama I made it (I made it)
She used to have to worry if I'm breathin'
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout us eatin' (Never)
Tell my mama I made it
So proud of her firstborn, I could tell (I know it)
She the only one sent me money in jail (Only one)
Tell my mama I made it

[Verse 1]
She used to hold me when I used to bang my head at night (Facts)
Ruth's Chris dinners don't taste as good as her eggs and rice (At all)
Couldn't be no punk, you told me early, ""Son, you better fight""
Handlebars shaky, I was beggin' you for a better bike
Think it was a Mongoose or one of them BMX shits
Innocent baby pictures, never seen me bein' arrested (Never)
It was nothin' domestic, I can't hit a woman (Uh-uh)
A woman raised me, woman fed me, woman bathed me
Ghetto changed me (Woo!)
Mama raised me strong, won't let 'em slave me (Never)
Thank you for not smokin' crack back in the eighties
I was born healthy (Mmm)
We ain't have too much at all, I wasn't born wealthy
I thank God for keeping me alive (The rest) until my mom's healthy

[Chorus]
Tell my mama I made it
Copped her a Rollie for the time we never spent (I love you, Ma)
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout no rent
Tell my mama I made it
She used to slap us when we used to try to cuss
I got sick of seein' you drivin' that bus
Tell my mama I made it (I made it)
She used to have to worry if I'm breathin' (Worry)
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout us eatin'
Tell my mama I made it
So proud of her firstborn, I could tell
She the only one sent me money in jail
Tell my mama I made it

[Verse 2]
When Freaky died, you told me, ""Dave, stop cryin'"" (Stop)
Used to be scared to tell the truth, you told me, ""Dave, stop lyin'"" (Uh)
You put too much inside my heart to hear that Dave stopped tryin'
It gotta be no tires or no gas if Dave not ridin'
You provided, I would ask you for expensive shit, you still would try to buy it
Disrespect my mother, I'ma start a riot
I see you lookin' tired, doin' the laundry
Hope Unc get off that rock, your baby brother been a zombie
I just let this drum blow, remember wakin' up
The whole crib smell like gumbo (Whole crib)
Or rice and beans when I would spend my night with fiends
You'd pray me and my brother just be cool
You just hoped me and my father never argue
Soon as I land, I'ma call you (Uh)

[Chorus]
Tell my mama I made it (Ma)
Copped her a Rollie for the time we never spent (Never)
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout no rent (Uh-uh)
Tell my mama I made it
She used to slap us when we used to try to cuss
I got sick of seein' you drivin' that bus
Tell my mama I made it (Mama, I made it)
She used to have to worry if I'm breathin'
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout us eatin'
Tell my mama I made it (Mama, I made it)
So proud of her firstborn, I could tell (I know)
She the only one sent me money in jail
Tell my mama I made it

[Verse 3]
Front on mama, rather get buried instead (Buried)
Introduced us to eatin' syrup and bread
Just tell my mama I made it (Uh)
I met a lotta people in life, but my mama my favorite
I think I'm lit but she remind me I'm David (Every time)
When I ain't know what I was goin' through in jail, I came home
And took you to Bloomingdale's
Missin' your perfume, thinkin' how you would smell
My mother, my heart, how could you honestly hate it? (How?)
Just wanna let her know, ""Yo, Ma, you the greatest""

[Chorus]
Tell my mama I made it
Copped her a Rollie for the time we never spent
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout no rent
Tell my mama I made it (Been with me all my life)
She used to slap us when we used to try to cuss
I got sick of seein' you drivin' that bus (So I drove for her, you na'mean?)
Tell my mama I made it
She used to have to worry if I'm breathin' (Mama)
She ain't never gotta worry 'bout us eatin'
Tell my mama I made it (Yeah)
So proud of her firstborn, I could tell (So proud)
She the only one sent me money in jail
Tell my mama I made it (Mama, I made it)

[Outro]
Tell my mama I made it
We're havin' conversations, mom and son, like that
Tell my mama I made it
I did it for her
Tell my mama I made it
Whatever success is in your own mind
Tell my mama I made it, yeah
Yeah, yeah, tell my mama I made it

You got that nigga on silent but he DMin' me
Could get him killed, but I'm gettin' money, don't need that energy

I swear every time you come, I go off (I shot my shot like Kobe, ma, you know me)
And every time you leave, I stay gone, woah, woah, woah

Adolescence was a nuisance

We fuck to Oochie Wally, told Jungle I caught a groupie
Niggas jackin' they security, punch 'em, they try to sue me
All my friends are dead, fuck a Draco, I came with an Uzi
Shit be staticky, you gotta pick a side
Knockin' Mary J. Blige, baggin' dimes, still surprised
I don't really need advice 'cause she already know the vibes
Like a kid at the playground, get excited just to slide
Juice box, that shit feel like I'm swimmin'
Pussy so good, I dump all of my women
I go off when I'm up in it, you get it

[Pre-Chorus: The-Dream & Dave East]
I swear every time you come, I go off (I shot my shot like Kobe, ma, you know me)

Different destinations, you deserve those visits (Woo)
Started in the orphanage but now you fortunate (Yes)
Aviator shades, we switchin' up all sort of shit (Uh)
I had a home just full of whores on Miami shores
Only exes know what go on when behind those doors
Follow code, my only feelings come in envelopes (Huh)
Hundred grand, rubber band, cold as a Michelob
And you know we get it for the wholesale
See me fishtail in a Porsche, stay off my coattail, yeah (Maybach Music)

[Outro: The-Dream]
Ain't nothin' better, so, girl, stop lookin' around
Ain't nothin' better than you and me right now
Ain't nothin' better, stop starin' in the crowd
I swear there's nothing you can see that you ain't already found

What's Goin On,Dave East,"

[Intro]
Yo, you know that bitch?
Come on, son, you know I know this bitch
You know that bitch
We used to see her at the store every mornin', the 2-4
Crescent?
Exactly, I used to fuck her sister but you ain't know that though
We gon' do tellys upstairs with Judy
Upstairs with Judy! Got 'em

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Uh, acknowledge I'm sent
Christian Dior probably my scent (Dior)
Five percent tint, that money dirty, gotta get rinsed
I'm probably in Philly, Auntie block, high, eatin' fish (Down Dauphin)
Diamond my wrist, better than the block pumpin', tryna get rent
Not in my circle? Then you tryna get spent (Spend up)
We're tryna get rich
Pull up knockin' Gladys on niggas
The way we livin' might embarrass you niggas
Might fade to black on you niggas
Depressed faces, they sad, mad I actually did it (Sad)
The homie died, I went and tatted my nigga (Freak)
Pinky ringin', me and four ladies at brunch
Got attitudes like they came on the bus, can't make this up
Cigar smoke lingerin', this gun on me large, it's not medium (Large)
Just got off them papers, he smokin' weed again
They was callin' me bro, catch a shot over that Nautica boat
I'm a wolf, never call me the goat (Never)
They all wanna know

[Chorus]
Betcha don't know what's goin' on (What's goin' on)
The streets don't love you like I do
Betcha don't know what's goin' on (What's goin' on)
The streets don't love you like I do
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Y'all don't even know
Betcha don't know

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah, my side different
They callin' us when the vibe driftin'
We the wave that got the tides shiftin'
I move weight, never tried liftin'
Never leave it, gotta ride with 'em
You nosey niggas probably tried sniffin'
Real tissue, the bros will wipe your nose
Makin' friends with the money expose all type of foes
I be super fly, these hoes just wipe my clothes
She's a easy target, you 'posed to snipe at those
In the Rolls doin' 60, bumpin' that Nipsey
Shorty with me kind of tiny, one drink and she tipsy
Always think she know somethin', be callin' her gypsy
Told her, ""Believe it or not,"" she callin' me Ripley
Aliens, yeah, the head outta this world
Took you to the Prada store, 'cause I'm proud of you, girl
Betcha don't know, probably 'cause it's too slept on
This that dope that make the block get they two-step on
You'll catch on

[Chorus]
Betcha don't know what's goin' on (What's goin' on)
The streets don't love you like I do
Betcha don't know what's goin' on (What's goin' on)
The streets don't love you like I do

Ooh, I think of you with pride

When times got hard, you had your boy with no stress (No)
Love is a war, you got me out here with no vest

We started out as friends but now we lovers
How we start out on the block and end up underneath them covers?
Let's try the backseat of my Benz without no rubber (Woo)
Pussy good, Kairi been saying she want a little brother (Ahh)
You think I'm joking right? I just got back from Cali
We can smoke tonight, I love scary movies, let's fuck to Poltergeist
I know the last cat did you wrong, I'm here to show ya right
I put in time to learn all about you, this wasn't overnight (Nah)
You my B-A-B-Y, no more wearing Levi (Nah)
Took you out Adida', we private like a G5

Your exes gotta be blind, just think you not in your prime

They look embarrassed when they seen us (Uh), put karats on her finger (Uh)
She watch too much Maury, this ain't ya average Jerry Springer (Nah)
I play the ball minglin' (Minglin'), Puerto Rican looking Armenian (Armenian)
A palm reader couldn't see our future, nah
Blacking off that pressure, I done lost my car key again
Style fifty shades of grey, I studied Kama Sutra
Hallelujah, knocking Odd Future, look in my eye like, ""I'll do ya""
We play Queens for the night, hit God Brewer
My past shorties tryna pop up like I knew ya (Knew ya)
I'm chasing cash, but this shit can get nasty as five sewers (Nasty)
A couple ice cubes in the glass, splash of Kahlúa (Woo)
We get into shit, but I been the shit, man that's manure
I be lying if I said I wasn't attracting cougars (Lyin')
We fucked with Ashanti on repeat, that shit was foolish
Shout out my youngin Yim, I'm with the movers, I'm the coolest (Uh)
Kept on my Rollie, she just tryna smoke me like I'm hookah
If that ain't ya lady, then why you take her to the jeweler? (Why?)
Don't embrace her like ya shoota, couple Aces in my cooler
That Versace shirt smooth but I'm smoother (Smoother)
I'm Slick Rick without the patch, introduced her to my ruler

[Refrain]
You my, yeah
You my (Baby)
You my (Baby)

[Chorus]
When times got hard, you had your boy with no stress (No)
Love is a war, you got me out here with no vest
I be up all night, I ain't been getting no rest (None)
I wish I had glasses to see what's under your dress (Word)
Baby give me your best (Best), I love how them jeans fit your waistline (Waistline)
Courtside, they see us on the baseline (They see us)
You turn me on every time we FaceTime
If you my baby, you gon' stay mine, you my (Baby)

[Verse 3]
This ain't nothin' they heard through the grapevine (Uh-uh)
They said if you love her, then you gon' make time
Even if she try to run, know I'm gon' chase mine
Disrespect that, I'm doin' federal or state time

[Refrain]
You my (Baby)
You my (Baby)

[Outro]
Oh, you my baby

Got me going crazy (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Jacquees & Dave East]
I can't leave you alone (Nah, nah)
You got me fiendin'
And I'm thinking and I'm dreaming about your love (Yes, ma'am)
Double cup how I'm drinkin' (Yeah)
Oh, girl, you got me fiendin' (What?)
Yes, ma'am, come move into my palace (Yeah)
Then let me change your address

[Verse 1: Dave East & Jacquees]
I cannot leave you alone
She said, ""Call me when you be alone""
'42, I don't drink no Patron
I can't wait 'til I get you alone (You got me fiendin')
I can't wait 'til you get out them clothes
Got your nails done and they matchin' your toes
I'm tryna be committed, Ma
Just let me hit it before I get back on this road (Oh yeah)
She text my phone, say she all alone and she got a room at the Westin (Yes, ma'am)
I hope she got over that attitude
I tried to send a DM to her best friend (Yes, ma'am)
She left my name at the front desk
Got an extra key when she checked in (Oh, oh)
No panties on, only sweats
I know we 'bout to make a mess
I don't wanna sound like I need you
But it's so hard to leave you alone
I was thirsty for the kill for real
It feel like I needed to bone
Two numbers just to keep in touch
It be so hard to keep up with phones
It been so hard to get out my zone
Three car garage and new key to my home
I like to fuck her to Jodeci (Yeah), she down to ride
If I gotta slide, fuck it, I might let her go with me
Go put on some clothes, you can roll with me
This time, I do not got the bro with me
She get on top of me, she started chokin' me
I guess she think she controllin' me
After we done, let her smoke with me (Come on)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
I can't leave you alone (Can't leave you alone)
You got me fiendin'
And I'm thinking and I'm dreaming about your love

I can't leave you alone (Leave you alone)
Ooh, you got me fiendin'
And I'm drinkin'
Double cup, thinkin' about your love, oh

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I hope she can see that I'm grown
Her body got me in the zone (Can't leave her alone)
We ain't gotta speak on the phone
As soon as I see her, it's on (Can't leave her alone)
I like to look at it while I'm up in it
These lights, we keeping 'em on (On)
She got tired of sleepin' alone (Alone)
On God, I can't leave her alone (Right?)
I do not wanna leave her alone (Nah)
Her body got me in the zone (Can't leave her alone)
We ain't gotta speak on the phone
As soon as I see her, it's on (Can't leave her alone)
I like to look at it while I'm up in it
These lights, we keeping 'em on
She got tired of sleepin' alone (Alone)
On God, I can't leave her alone

[Refrain: Dave East & Jacquees]
I can tell you never felt like this in your entire life
Let me get some pussy right before I go outside tonight
You look like you got some good head, you not Blac Chyna type
She not out here fuckin', I can tell that 'nani extra tight

[Verse 3: Dave East & Jacquees]
Pack your bag and catch a flight
Rub you down with oils

You knew I was holdin' so don't act surprised, I

Everyday,Dave East,"

[Verse 1: Dave East]
I got this shit from the trap
Few  baggies, my pen, and my pad (Few baggies)
I  done got rich off of rap (Racks)
You throw 'em, we sendin' 'em back, that shit is a fact
My young boy ain't got no ID on 'em
He  had to slip through the back (Go in the back)
They  took everything he had off his body
He thought he was lit 'cause he rap
Gotta  hustle, go get off your back (Get out)
He broke, go get him a pack
I just blew ten up in Saks (Dimes)
Fuck cops, they kill if you black (Fuck 'em)
You  might get a deal if you nice (You might)
Gelato I'm smokin' to give you the feelin' you feel when you still on a flight
Light up a blunt, go wheelie that bike (Go wheelie that bike)
(This is our life)

[Chorus: Gunna]
This a lifestyle that we cherish everyday
Takin' risks to count this cash in every way
If you lucky, bitch, then you just might get saved
Only thing on my bucket list is I get paid
Fuck the coppers, you can't stop us like a train
Like a doctor, I got meds to heal my pain
Push start all my vehicles sport, you'd think I race
Bright stars shine on me in the dark inside my Wraith

[Verse 2: Gunna]
I caught a plain Patek Philippe and a plain Richard Mille (Yeah)
Can't explain this shit I see, switchin' lanes in a new V
I done slang on every corner, I done made it out the streets
Lotta lames in this industry
Sucker free, me and Dave East (Yeah)
My neck look like water, 200 sittin' on a plain tee (Yeah)
Rich my persona, I fucked your bitch a new Wrangler Jeep
Keep that stick on me, 'cause if they play, we gon' play for keeps
Back to back Royces, me and Meek
We the champs that they envy (Champs)

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I'm a cold P-I-M-P
I got hoes in the Benz Jeep
I smoke Oprah Winfrey
While my bro pumpin' *NSYNC
The gas the color purple, sellin' white boy like Nowitzki
The cars is foreign like Ginobili, shots burn your chest like whiskey

[Chorus: Gunna]
This a lifestyle that we cherish everyday
Takin' risks to count this cash in every way
If you lucky, bitch, then you just might get saved
Only thing on my bucket list is I get paid
Fuck the coppers, you can't stop us like a train
Like a doctor, I got meds to heal my pain
Push start all my vehicles sport, you'd think I race
Bright stars shine on me in the dark inside my Wraith

[Verse 4: Dave East]
Popular nigga, I'm not tryna start, this is not the beginning
These niggas is broke, I forgot to forget it
Sand in my toes, bitch, I'm tropical livin'
I try not to pay no attention, they probably gon' hate 'til I'm finished
Fuck it, as long as they pay me with interest
Buckets now, I jump out Ranges that's tinted
Smile at them niggas, they hate when you grinnin'
I got a Patek that I put on everyday
I just watched you eat that bitch, how you not gay?
I'm at the gun range just to practice on my aim
Bitch this Crip, watch how I get rich, Gunna know my game

[Verse 5: Gunna]
Just might got trust issues, I'm goin' bonkers, you fuck with me
Once my mind made up, I'm pullin' up like the Grim Reaper
Since I like drippin', my swag is blue and that's all I see
Ain't no rap cappin', this lifestyle true, ain't no flaw in me

[Chorus: Gunna]
This a lifestyle that we cherish everyday
Takin' risks to count this cash in every way
If you lucky, bitch, then you just might get saved
Only thing on my bucket list is I get paid
Fuck the coppers, you can't stop us like a train
Like a doctor, I got meds to heal my pain
Push start all my vehicles sport, you'd think I race

Devil Eyes,Dave East,"

[Intro]
Ayy, cuz, Nixon disrespect will not be tolerated in the Dirt, nigga
That's how you end up on a shirt, cuz (The Mekanix)
That's on 39th Street, nigga
Stay away from rats
Fuck a nigga mean, cuz? Dirt Gang

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Before you shoot him, look him in his eyes
Introduce him to God, they ain't got shit to do with mines (Amen)
Shit get real nasty, gotta move your mom
It was either become a body or go and do some time
I knew a couple niggas, all they knew was crime (That's it)
Tryna disrespect the set is where we drew the line
Get killed, askin' what time it was when you knew the time
If Check found a gun in the crib, he already knew it's mine (On God)
The president don't give a fuck about the country (At all)
Them child support payments been fuckin' up your monthly (Damn)
It was hard to think in class knowin' you was hungry (Starvin')
Them bitches said that you was trash just 'cause you was bummy
Chip on my shoulder, I felt a way about it (Still)
Opps caught me dolo, thought they had me, found my way up out it
You in the field, gotta walk through the streets, ain't no way around it
His mama lost her mind, she couldn't believe the way they found him

[Chorus: Dave East]
All through the ghetto we would terrorize
His closest nigga died, he ain't lettin' it slide (Uh-uh)
He pray to God but he been lookin' through the devil eyes
He got his mask on so nobody could recognize (Nobody)
I could paint a picture like I'm Basquiat (I can)
Every other day, another body drop
Ain't nowhere to run if they surround the block (Nowhere)
We up with the sun, trap around the clock

[Verse 2: E-40]
How to get out (Get out)
All the niggas that got on before him taught him how to get out (Get out)
Specialize in scoring, crack your crin-own (Crin-own)
Ridin' around in them foreigns, have they L out (L out)
Gotta make sure that you covered up like a blanket or you gonna get covered up with a blanket (Blanket)
Don't be no fruitcake, you can't be no edible arrangement ('Rangement)
Comin' up out of the region where we at (Where we at)
Gotta be a lion, not a cat (Not a cat)
They don't wanna listen, don't wanna learn (Don't wanna learn)
Their parents on yola, they not concerned (They not concerned)
The cha-cha, the cola, money I earned (Money I earned)
The bakin', the soda, I flipped and turned
They might not thought I paid attention, but I was listenin' (I was listenin')
My master bedroom bigger than the house I grew up in (Grew up in)
Me, my bloods, my cousins, and my siblings (And my siblings)
I don't trust nobody, I ain't got no friends (I ain't got no friends, bitch)

[Chorus: Dave East]
All through the ghetto we would terrorize
His closest nigga died, he ain't lettin' it slide
He pray to God but he been lookin' through the devil eyes
He got his mask on so nobody could recognize
I could paint a picture like I'm Basquiat
Every other day, another body drop
Ain't nowhere to run if they surround the block
We up with the sun, trap around the clock (Uh)

[Verse 3: Mozzy]
FaceTimed a snakey just to show the drakey
You ever stripped a nigga naked off of naked lady?
Several cases on the gravel where they tackled dude
Eukanuba for the shooters, that's a bag of food
Ask his mama why he left, them niggas had to move
We hoppin' out, half of moons on a half a broom
Passes ain't permitted, ain't no passin' through
Unless you niggas tryna cop a Pacquiao or two, ooh
Run a demonstration for initiation
Tuck a quarter for the litigated situation
Niggas show up at your mama's, know no limitation
When we was into stealin' foreigns, you was stealin' bases
You niggas was ditchin' class, we was ditchin' agents
Big bro 'posed to be proud his little nigga made it
It's written on they faces, I could feel the hatred
Fuck the money, it get gully, nigga still a gangster

[Chorus: Dave East]
All through the ghetto we would terrorize
His closest nigga died, he ain't lettin' it slide
He pray to God but he been lookin' through the devil eyes
He got his mask on so nobody could recognize
I could paint a picture like I'm Basquiat
Every other day, another body drop
Ain't nowhere to run if they surround the block
We up with the sun, trap around the clock
All through the ghetto we would terrorize
His closest nigga died, he ain't lettin' it slide
He pray to God but he been lookin' through the devil eyes
He got his mask on so nobody could recognize
I could paint a picture like I'm Basquiat
Every other day, another body drop
Ain't nowhere to run if they surround the block
We up with the sun, trap around the clock

[Outro: Dave East]
Let a nigga try to extort the homie
On my mama, we probably torture homie
Let a nigga try to extort the homie
On my mama (On my mama)
Let a nigga try to extort the homie
On my mama, we probably torture homie
(Talk about the streets, talk about the struggle, man)
Yo, listen, man
On the streets, man, listen, man, you gotta survive, you gotta learn how to hit every angle
I mean, in every different aspect and situation
You know what I'm sayin'?
My life in the streets, man, I'm a drug addict, I smoke crack cocaine
My name is **** ****, I was born and raised on 4015
12th Street, Apartment 6B
My mother got life in prison for smoking crack
And unfortunately I have become, or I just, you know
I lessened myself to smoke crack
Because, you know, I just wanted to smoke crack, be a bum
You know, I felt like that was cool
I don't know what I, you know, was attracted to, but
I mean, I don't know
But I'm in the streets, so you just gotta get it, man
You just gotta get it, man
Listen, money is cool, but you know, relationships is better
(What are the things you do to survive?)
Man, I, I mean, I don't know, I steal from stores, man
I mean, I, I, fuckin', I don't know, man, I just try
I just try, man

Night Shift,Dave East,"

[Chorus: Dave East]
I trapped on the night shift
I seen my uncle addicted to white shit
I pulled up with a nice bitch
My license suspended so that's who I slide with
I'm ready for anything
Outside with a Glock, in jail with an ice pick
Just put your money down
Nobody make a move until the dice hit (M-M-Murda, uh)
I got my money up (Uh)
Tellin' promoters I switched up my prices
I brought Dre Mack with me (Mack)
He gon' run down, he don't care who your wife is (He don't care)
I'm tryna live righteous (Righteous)
Couldn't get bail, they said he was a flight risk (Pew)
Why these niggas on my dick? (Why?)
If I see it, I want it, I like it, I buy it

[Verse 1: Dave East]
You need like fifty pills? I could get 'em
I got like nine bitches in the Sprinter
I just got some head, she just wanted dinner
Half my niggas dead, half up in the prison
40 on me, handle business
I ain't got no time to think about no witness
Leave 'em in the river, wakin' up with fishes
I get all my diamonds from the district
I got all my haters at attention
Try pull me over, not stoppin' at lights
If I hop out, I'm jumpin' over fences
Can't fuck with bitches, they just want attention
My diamonds yellow, I look like a Simpson
Her brain amazin' like she went to Princeton (Amazing)
Her name was Monica, I felt like Clinton

[Chorus: Dave East]
I trapped on the night shift (Graveyard)
I seen my uncle addicted to white shit (White shit)
I pulled up with a nice bitch
My license suspended so that's who I slide with (Skrrt)
I'm ready for anything (Anything)
Outside with a Glock, in jail with an ice pick

Why these niggas on my dick? (Why?)
If I see it, I want it, I like it, I buy it

[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
We in New York (York)
Couldn't get the blicky, so I got the knife in
Bad vibe with me, lightskin
And she textin', say I'm trifling
I've been sipping all this syrup
Then I looked up, damn, where the night went?
Maybach with the light tint
I gotta see if the cops coming
If the paper the subject, I ain't done
If the bitch is not fucking, she can't come
I've been popping these Addys, I can't sleep
I've been Cripping on beats like I'm Dave East
Put a new supercharger on a Hellcat
Had a hell of a week, where the bales at?
Tryna put that ho leg where her arm at
This shit deeper than rap, we be on that

[Chorus: Dave East]
I trapped on the night shift (Graveyard)
I seen my uncle addicted to white shit (White shit)

Why these niggas on my dick?
If I see it, I want it, I like it, I buy it

[Interlude]
Um, like, what is you doin'?
Is you rappin'? You trappin'? Like
Pick up your fucking phone
Stop playing with me, like I know you not that fucking busy, like
And it better not be no bitches in there
I'm not playing, yo

[Verse 3: Dave East]
I'm in Los Angeles, cool, but I've always been scandalous
We might rob you and your manager
Photographer with you, we need a new camera
After we shoot, light a candle up
Don't hit her phone when I land in her city
That shit got her all in her feelings (My bad)
I don't get searched
So I got hitters that pass me a strap 'til they get in the building
I come from public housing where they killing
Couldn't get a job is why he started dealing
Couldn't get no help is why he started stealing
He not hisself, that's why they never feel him
I ain't popped a Xan' in a minute
I ain't fucked a fan in a minute
Last time, was standing up in it
Disrespect my man, I'm offended

[Chorus: Dave East]
I trapped on the night shift (Graveyard)
I seen my uncle addicted to white shit (White shit)
I pulled up with a nice bitch
My license suspended so that's who I slide with (Skrrt)

The shit that he be goin' through, you'll probably never see (Oh)
Shorty caught up in the streets (Caught up)
Shorty wanna be a G
He built for the hood, when it get dark he still could see
He tatted his homies on him 'cause most of them deceased

Niggas is ignorant, niggas inconsiderate
Niggas be innocent, but still go to jail
Can't stand the pressure, they fuck around, they go and tell
But I don't shoot shade
Step back, shoot a fade
Marry the streets young, she toss up the bouquet
Bottle of D'Usse, let's crusade
Nigga be jelly, they hate the Bigga, touché
Time out on the stove, momma out in the cold
Chain 300 thou', ridin' out in a Rolls

She hold my gun in her purse, me and her been through the worst, just me and my bitch (Clue)
I told her how to get hundreds in, I even told her my government
I told her the right way to suck a dick
Told her stay away from sucker shit
Just me and bitch in the drop, she listen to Biggie and Pac (She one of the realist)
She knows I got hoes on my top, she can't wait for my shit to drop (She not in her feelings)
I wake up all in her mouth, got ass like she from the south (I'm not tryna chill)
I hit it all on the couch, don't know what she talkin' about (Like, ""How do it feel?"")
To be with a nigga that's real
We don't be poppin' no pills, just me and my bitch
Christian or Prada her heels, she call me when I'm in the field, ""Let's meet at The Ritz""
Might have to AP her wrist, I love when she naked in pics (My bitch is the shit)
Niggas shoot shots and they miss, she fly when it's not an event, just me and my bitch (My bitch)
She don't get nervous if I tell her ride with the stick, she just tryna find out how to get rich
She ain't really tryna hop in no pics
Pussy good, got me coppin' her shit
Just me and my bitch in the coupe, we get low
Just me and my bitch, we be doin' the most
Yeah, that's my bitch, I'm like, ""Who wanna know?""
Just me and my bitch (World Famous DJ Clue)

[Verse 3]
Just me and my gun, I never needed to run (Never)
We used to keep it for fun (Uh, Desert Storm)
I ain't need no homies around me
It was just me and my gun
I got it on me, you need me to come
If I pull it out when they see me, they done
Just me and my gun
I bought some bullets to load it with
I feel violated, I'm blowin' it
Ain't ask him for it 'cause I'm holdin' it
I keep it tucked, I ain't showin' it
Just me and my gun, a couple dollars, and some weed, all I need on the run
Threw a shot at his stomach and if he survive it, he gon' probably need a lung
It's not a doctor alive could bring you back, never seen it get done
Just me and my gun, had a body on it, bought it as cheap as they come
Our guns change like the weather can
I just pray that they don't never jam (I pray)
.40 on me, no stage fright, catch him late night, David Letterman
Just me and my gun, I wanted to roll, but I really just needed a blunt (Light up)
Where I'm from, gotta keep you a gun
You never been chased 'til your sneakers is done? (Run)
Niggas'll come for you in your dreams, so you gotta sleep with a gun
It's on me like a tat, niggas love to rat, so it's just me and my gun

[Outro]
I don't need none of these niggas around me (DJ Clue, Dave East)
My daughter and my gun, nigga (Stupid)
I'm good

Daddy Knows,Dave East,"

[Intro: Dave East & Kairi East]
Kairi, you know you about to be on my album?
Yeah
Do you know that, hmm?
Yeah
I love you
I love you, dada, I love you, dada
I love dada
We gotta make the music right here
Okay
Make the music right here and then you play the piano
Okay

[Chorus: Ash Leone]
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)
Daddy packs his bills up real high (Through the ceiling, ceiling)
I don't ask no questions, ask no whys (I just listen, listen)
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)

[Verse 1: Dave East]
Ain't nothing cooler than being your dad
I could be mad at the world, soon as I see you, I'm glad
For you, I go hard, can't tell me, Dave, you need to relax
Daddy chasing a bag
When I don't get to see you is wack
I see my eyes when I look in your eyes
I see my nose when I look at your nose
I can feel you in my soul
Feel like I knew you forever, you only two years old
Your father love you, no matter the stories you get told
I was there the day you came out your moms
So small, could fit your face in my palm
I used to pray you was strong
You got my last name, you my earth, a goddess, a queen
The same month you was born I stopped drinking lean
I see the world different
Just me and my little girl chilling
Violate, I make the world feel it
When Nas made that song about daughters, ain't know the lyrics
You was born yet, now I'm listening, I can feel it

[Chorus: Ash Leone]
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)
Daddy packs his bills up real high (Through the ceiling, ceiling)
I don't ask no questions, ask no whys (I just listen, listen)
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing better than knowin' you mines
I see your face on FaceTime and I know why I grind
It was the 9th of March, never been so nervous in my life
I mean, I'm from the hood where niggas get murdered over dice
What kind of daddy would I be?
I done sold drugs, been in jail, been denied bail, with my homie hoping he don't tell
I never changed a diaper before, I helped Ayeshia with Jamir but that was light, he a boy
Little girls is the future of our world
Can't impress with just diamonds or some pearls, my daughter gotta be thorough
You half Puerto-Rican, half black
I trade it all for you before I write my last rap
When you get older, I'll tell you how I stash packs
And tucked weed in my socks and had to flee from the cops
But forget that, I'd rather teach you 'bout independence
And how the world is yours and you don't need nobody in it (Word)

[Chorus: Ash Leone]
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)
Daddy packs his bills up real high (Through the ceiling, ceiling)
I don't ask no questions, ask no whys (I just listen, listen)
Daddy's arm is like a turnstile (All these women, women)

What You Mad At,Dave East,"

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah, yo, I'm sick of all these directional-ass rappin'-ass niggas (Tsk, uhh, yo)
You know what I'm sayin'?
You got Wests in the shit, now we got this East nigga (Yo, yo, you, you hatin')
Get the fuck outta here, man, for real (Dave East is hot, he hot)
What kind of shit is this, man? (He hot, son, Harlem nigga, I fuck with 'em)
I'ma get my own rappers, nigga (Yeah) like Mike North or somethin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Down South Black or somethin', you know what I mean?
These directional-ass niggas (Ah, nigga, you ain't got no money, nigga, Nas signed 'em, for real)
Man, I don't give a fuck, man, who cares, man? (Yeah, he hot, he Def Jam)
He ain't signed no basketball team, nigga, the nigga 6'4"", nigga (Ahh, you a hater, bitches like that)
Sign 'em to the CBA or somethin', nigga
This rap shit is over, man, for real, man, for real (Aw, nah, nah, nah)
Why you mad, son?
I'm just sayin', son, my shit is still Stanley steamin', you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm still the johnniest of 'em all, fam
This nigga here, man, I don't even get it, I just—
I'm mad, son, I'm mad

[Chorus]
Tell me, what the fuck is you mad at?
I came up from nothin' and got it, fuck is you mad at?
I never got to see it, I need it, I never had that
We all go the same twenty-four hours, what you mad at?
Tell me, what the fuck is you mad at?
I came up from nothin' and got it, fuck is you mad at?
I never got to see it, I need it, I never had that
We all go the same twenty-four hours, what you mad at?

[Verse 1]
You never went to school with weapons in your backpack
Walkin' through the halls like, ""Yeah, I had that""
I'm just tryna backtrack and understand what these niggas so mad at
Tryna cop a dime, I ain't had five, I couldn't match that
My waist was where the strap usually was stashed at
A boss gon' put that paper on your shit, bump like a snapback
You never was my man, reach out your hand, I ain't gon' dap that
You hate me, but you see me, like, ""Yo, Dave, get on my Snapchat""
I never wanted to be like you niggas, always look past that
So eager, nobody knew me neither, fuck you so mad at?
I could still slide through the spots that I used to trap at
I was taught to get it and ask, ""The fuck is the cash at?""

[Chorus]
Tell me, what the fuck is you mad at?
I came up from nothin' and got it, fuck is you mad at?
I never got to see it, I need it, I never had that
We all go the same twenty-four hours, what you mad at?
Tell me, what the fuck is you mad at?
I came up from nothin' and got it, fuck is you mad at?
I never got to see it, I need it, I never had that
We all go the same twenty-four hours, what you mad at?

[Verse 2]
This shit is more than entertainment
My daughter got me changin', keep my lawyer on retainer
Nobody knew my name, I was performin' like I'm famous
So far from the top, but I still saw it from the basement
The shit I spoke about is embedded, you can't erase it
I never drove a foreign before, I just wanted to race it
How you plan to hit the next level? Don't know the basics
I talk to God then talk to the devil, my life is dangerous

[Interlude]
Survival

[Chorus]
I know why you mad, nigga
I know why you mad
I know why you mad, nigga
I know why you mad
I know why you mad

[Verse 3]
I know why you mad, nigga
I made goal out of trash, nigga
I only hit the club for a bag, nigga
I know why you mad, nigga
Misery love company, will not be no sad nigga
Born with it, I act just like my dad, nigga
Pack flipper, no ass-kisser, I'm that nigga
They don't love you 'til you die, you can keep your congrats, nigga
Look you dead in your eye, can't disguise that you're mad, nigga
This life been hard, we ain't have many reasons to laugh, nigga
Put your work in, the NBA don't just draft niggas
Lead and never follow, go create your own path, nigga
Fresh out the cell to a V12, blow right past niggas
I worked too hard to be a broke-ass nigga
Lost with no hope ass-nigga
Ran out of favors, so just don't ask, nigga
Don't ask me shit you know you won't ask Jigga
I was on Hov ave bitter
Face unfamiliar, I don't know that nigga
If it ain't pressure I don't roll that, nigga
You live on throwback pictures
Reminiscin' on the times when you had it
Talkin' how you had a Benz and you survived when you crashed it
Scared? Go to church or see who read the bible the fastest
They use love, they won't acknowledge a master
They just reply to you faster
Everybody used to go but I ran out of them passes
Surrounded by ghosts and I don't know Casper
I know why you mad, I'm about to own all of my masters
Canada, I'm comin' soon, I'm tryna glow up my passport
This is me, build and empire and we can split the fee
I ain't charge 'em, I was gettin' shit for free
Regardless, I'ma eat

[Chorus]
I know why you mad, nigga
It's funny what the money do, just know that I laugh, nigga
I know why you mad
I know why you mad, nigga
I know why you mad
I know why you mad, nigga
I know why you mad

[Outro]
Yeah, simple math
They got the bitches, they got the money, they got the cars, they got the crib
They travel around the world, they smokin' that exotic
Shit, if I was you, I'd be mad, too

Champagne Town,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I got there late, blame it on the rain
Guess I gotta stay another night
In this town full of lights guys like me don't like
Yeah, I flagged a yellow car, found a smoky bar
Threw this ol' heart on a stool
Let me and this 90-proof do what we gotta do

[Chorus]
So I'm here drinking whiskey in a champagne town
While you're trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

[Verse 2]
I was just a stop along the way
Just a phase you were going through
In the back of your mind, you knew
What this was coming to, yeah, so did I
But it still burns tonight just like this

[Chorus]
Whiskey in a champagne town
While you're trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

[Chorus]
Sitting here drinking whiskey in a champagne town
Are you trying not to miss me
Like I'm trying not to miss you now?
Blaming you by two and me by three
It's plain to see all I'll ever be to you
Is what I am right now
Nothing but whiskey in a champagne town

[Outro]
Ain't nothing but whiskey, whiskey
In a champagne town
Ain't nothing but whiskey, whiskey
In a champagne town

We Back,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kind of red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and a Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days?
Straight up gettin' sideways

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

[Verse 2]
Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes
Getting picked up in a pickup
And kickin' it with guys like us

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

[Bridge]
Sun comes up and sun goes down, yeah
Everything good comes back around
We back, we back

[Chorus]
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back (We back, we back in the speakers)
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back (We back, we back
It's probably true what my mama said)
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back

Blame It On You,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
Goin' down like a sunset
Burnin' out like a cigarette
Blowin' through the cash, through the past
Drinking down that memory 'til there's nothin' left

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

[Post-Chorus]
I could say I never knew
I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)
Yeah, yeah (Baby, do you still think about me too?)

[Verse 2]
Trying to ride out the midnight
Trying to fight through the daylight
Wonderin' where you're at, and just like that
I'm lookin' back on what I had when you were mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I could go on and on (For a long, long time, yeah)
Why you're gone

[Chorus]
I could blame it on the whiskey
I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go
I could blame it on a good high
Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

Yeah, I can drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you (Do you still think about me too?)

Yeah, I could drink around the truth (For a long, long time, yeah)

I Don’t Drink Anymore,Jason Aldean,"

[Verse 1]
She don't like this bar
She don't like my friends
She thinks we party too hard
She said it's me or them
She said I need to change my ways
Boy, you got a choice to make

[Chorus]
So I don't drink anymore
Ever since she left
I don't drink anymore
And I don't drink any less

[Verse 2]
She picked a bad time
To try and slow me down
And this ain't a good night
To try and turn me around
I still like to get crazy, nothing new
Still like to have a few

[Chorus]
But I don't drink anymore
Ever since she left
I don't drink anymore
And I don't drink any less

[Verse 3]
I didn't want her to go
And it's not that I don't give a damn
I just want someone to want me
For who I am
And this is who I am

[Bridge]
She said I need to change my ways
Boy, you got a choice to make

[Chorus]
So I don't drink any more
Yeah, tonight you can bet
I don't drink any more
And I don't drink any less

Well, I don't drink any more
And I don't drink any less

And that red dirt on the bottom of our boots
And this place runs thirty-five miles an hour
And that hard work runs in our roots

Yeah, we're all just backbone blue collar people
Burning that Texaco black smoke diesel

[Chorus]
Yeah, we're keeping it small town, keeping it slow
Keep that dust stirred up on them old dirt roads

Yeah, learned to pray, learned to cuss
Throw a party, throw a punch
Ain't no hidin' where we're from

It was out in the fields, on them old backroads
It covers this town like it covers my soul
Yeah, it's in our bones, in our blood
Yeah, as deep as these roots run
We'll never be too far gone
From the dirt we were raised on
Dirt we were raised on

[Verse 2]
Baled some hay on it
Asked God to rain on it
We met 'em at the gate when they tried to put an interstate on it

Yeah, we got lost, we got found
And we got high and we got down
And every time we rolled into town

Yeah, it's the red stuff flying in the back of a truck bed
Goin' out as far as you can get
Windows down, turned up to a country song
That's the dirt we were raised on
Sunsets and a bullet hole stop sign
Gettin' down on a back 45
Yeah, that's how we do it all night long
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on
That's the dirt we were raised on

You can find 'em 'bout sundown Friday
Coming outta them fields for the highway
First stop, Texaco, fill a cooler full of cold beer
Paycheck sitting on the console
Gotta get it in the bank 'fore the doors close
Call your boys, get your girl, time to throw it in another gear

[Chorus]
Here they come, rollin' down Main Street
A country song spinnin' on a CD
Small town, lookin' for a good time
Raise a little hell and a drink at the county line
Muddy boots, muddy tires
Wrap your baby in your jacket by the fire
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they got it bad
For good ol' boys in a camouflage hat

[Verse 2]
Country girls know how to love
And how to pretty up a pickup truck
Fallin' for a rolled-up flannel under tailgate stars
And country boys, they hold 'em tight
Best believe they gonna treat 'em right
'Cause they'll be dealin' with a daddy if they break their hearts

[Chorus]
Yeah, here they come, rollin' down Main Street
A country song spinnin' on a CD
Small town, lookin' for a good time
Raise a little hell and a drink at the county line
Muddy boots, muddy tires
Wrap your baby in your jacket by the fire
Yeah, the girls 'round here, they got it bad
For good ol' boys in a camouflage—

Lay it on the seat or up on the dashboard
Let her put it on and you'll never get it back, boy
Yeah, camouflage hat

Stronger Magic,Leslie Odom Jr.,"

Always try to dim my light no matter how bright I shine
But I've got my standards that I'm never letting die

And I bleed 'cause of pride, you're not bleedin' me dry
Cannot abide, I got my head on a swivel this time
Why would I let you just twist it aside?
I catch a fever when they're aiming at the way I live my life

[Chorus]
These are my standards, I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
These are my standards

[Verse 3]
When I called for help, you didn't pick up your phone
You saw my kingly potential so you kept me from my throne
The truth is, I'm demonized for standing my own ground
So you push me to the deep end, hoping I drown

[Bridge]
But I've got my–
I've got my bee-bm, bah-bm, bee-a-bm, bee-day
Anybody hold you to it, I don't need you
Ah, di-ba-boo, ooh

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die
These are my standards

[Verse 4]
'Cause I won't let you treat me so unfair
Don't I deserve my God-given share?
Whether I've got a dollar or I'm a billionaire
These are my standards, I ain't gon' never, never let 'em die

[Outro]
Because of pride, losing my spine (Hey! Hey!)
I got my head on a swivel this time (Hey!)
Why would I let ya? (Why would I let ya?)
I catch a fever when they're aiming at the way I live my life
(Hey!) These are my standards that I'm never letting die

Getting stuck in her molasses

Under Pressure,Leslie Odom Jr.,"

[Verse 1]
Days are getting cold
Darkness lies on expired dreams
While the spotlight shines down on me
But you're cornered, and can't back away

[Pre-Chorus]
Being so many things to so many
Reaching for it all when you can't have any

[Chorus]
Under pressure
Under pressure
This is far too much to take
I'm afraid I might break under pressure
Under pressure

[Verse 2]
You ask me who I think I am
I’ll plead the fifth, I won’t take the stand
Judgment falls but is it heard?
Jury’s hung, justice won’t be served

Being so many things can be heavy
Reeling from it all, can get you buried

[Chorus]
Under pressure
Under pressure
This is far too much to take
I'm afraid I might break under pressure

These are the paintings great painters paint

Cold,Leslie Odom Jr.,"

[Verse 1]
You lost yourself on empty promises
Broken on the way
All you've ever known are dishonest men
Who don't ever change

[Pre-Chorus]
So you're keeping all your secrets
By you wrapped up tight
You're who I believe in
So why say goodnight?

[Chorus]
Don't listen to all you've been told
You can come in from the cold
And you know the safest place to be
Is right here next to me
Won't you come in from the cold?

[Verse 2]
Wanna help you ease the feeling
Weighing on your mind
You're looking for a reason
Running out of time

[Pre-Chorus]
You're keeping all your secrets
By you wrapped up tight
You're who I believe in
So why say goodnight?

[Chorus]
Don't listen to all you've been told
You can come in from the cold
And you know the safest place to be
Is right here next to me
Won't you come in from the cold?

[Bridge]
I know your heart's telling you, ""Run now""
Run so far away (Run so far away)
The self is trying to reach out (Trying to reach out)
Shine a light into the grey (Light into the grey)
I know how hard it is to take a chance when it calls your name
So I pray (I pray, Oh I pray, I pray)
I pray

[Chorus]
Don't listen to all you've been told
You can come in from the cold
And you know the safest place to be
Is right here next to me
Won't you come in from the cold?
Won't you come in from the cold?
Won't you come in from the cold?

Lose It,Leslie Odom Jr.,"

Them grins used to be sweeter

Currents were stronger
Now it's all underwater (All underwater)

[Refrain]
Where did we lose it?
Why did we lose it?
Why did we lose it? Oh, no, no
Why did we lose it?

Autumn was longer
And the summer burns stronger
But I still keep thirty flowers [?]
Ones that used to be ours

[Refrain]
Where did we lose it?
Where did we lose it?
Where did we lose it? Oh, no, no
Where did I lose you?

[Bridge]
Might seem strange to wish for everything the same
And time has ways of smoothening the memories made
Might seem strange to wish for everything the same
Life runs fast, the best to come is now just past

[Verse 3]
I know that she’s rising above the quiet
We just kept flying higher
But I never could have known
It was as high as we would ever go

[Refrain]
Where did we lose it?
Where did we lose it? Oh, ooh, oh
Where did we lose it?
Where did we lose it?

Eva's Song (A Psalm Of Life),Leslie Odom Jr.,"

[Skit]
Life is but an empty dream
For the soul is dead that slumbers
And things are not just as they seem
Life is real, life is earnest
And the grave is not its goal
""Dust thou art, to dust return""
Was not spoken of the soul
Not enjoyment, nor in sorrow
Is our destined end or way
But to act, that each tomorrow
Finds us farther than today
Art is long, and time is fleeting
And our hearts grow stout and brave
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave
Trust no future, however pleasant
Let the dead past bury its dead
Act, act in the living presence
Heart within, and God overhead

"
Foggy,Leslie Odom Jr.,"

[Verse 1]
Foggy, sun peeking through the gray
It's foggy, smoke rising on the day
And baby, I can't pry myself out of your arms

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll call in sick today
'Cause feeling this way's too good to waste on coffee
The morning, angel girl, is foggy

[Refrain]
We're living in a shit show
Modern day Romeo
But I forget, my Juliet, ain't no time for you
People calling me, list of things to do

[Verse 3]
""Sorry,"" may sound so trite to say
My darling, let's not get up today
And maybe I'll find a way to right this wrong

[Verse 4]
You said you wanted to disappear
Miss Capulet, your hair's all done and your cheek's all wet, yeah
Forgive me, memories fade, and I forget, I'm foggy

[Refrain]
'Cause every day's a shit show
Modern day Romeo
But I forget you're Juliet, ain't no time for you
People calling me, people calling you

[Bridge]
Oh, running in the rat race
I forgot to make the time and space
For us to be just you and me
Something in my heart says
That we need to find a way to break away
Today could be the perfect day to breathe

[Outro]
Foggy
My darling, yeah-eh-eh
Baby, look out your window
Girl, it's foggy

Oh, how the time goes by
Boy, how you never left my mind
That's that West Coast love

[Post-Chorus]
West Coast love
Never left my mind
West Coast love
Never left my mind

Sundays,Emotional Oranges,"

[Verse 1]
I see you more than I should and it hurts my pride
I'm affected by you (Affected by you)
Then we go back and forth, undecided
You and I just spiral
Wonder why we fight it (Wonder why we fight, oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
How could you ever question me?
Shit hit me in my chest today
I remember like it's yesterday
Gave you my best, you just gave it away

[Chorus]
Sundays with you were special (Special)
I still don't know how to let go (Let go)
Why did you keep in touch? (Touch)
Thought we was deep in love (Love)
You didn't believe in us
Boy, you forgot what we had (We had)

[Verse 2]
I need you more than I should
I can't help but love you
Although it hurts to trust you, but
And we go back and forth
Girl, I'm tired, give you my undivided
Our love is so one-sided, look

How could you ever question me?
Shit hit me in my chest today

Gave you my best, you just gave it away

Heal My Desires,Emotional Oranges,"

[Verse 1]
In the shadows of my father
Watched all his mistakes
And I did my best to learn from
Change my motivation
The family's for certain
I'm not curious anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
They still callin' me up
But they keep showin' up nameless
Think they callin' my bluff
But I'm ready to lose it all

[Chorus]
Heal my desires, yeah
You heal my desire, baby (Baby)
Done some things I ain't proud of, yeah
But I've always been honest and
You heal my desires

[Verse 2]
Baby, all you need to know is I'ma hold you down
Be there by your side, I'ma never slow you down
Show me I'm more than she was (Show me I'm more than she was)
Show me I'm more than a number

They still callin' me up
But they keep showin' up nameless
Think they callin' my bluff
But I'm ready to lose it all

Done some things I ain't proud of, yeah

For The First Time,Best Coast,"

[Verse 1: Bethany Consentino]
Trying really hard
I'm trying harder than I ever have before
Used to think that taking care of myself would just become a real bore
On Friday nights I don't spend too much time lying on the bathroom floor, like I used to
The demons deep inside of me
They might have finally been set free

[Chorus: Bethany Consentino]
And I guess this is what they mean
When they say
People can change
'Cause I finally feel free
I feel like myself again
But for the first time

[Verse 2: Bethany Consentino]
I changed the colors of the bed sheets
Now they are a pretty pale pink
Traded her in for a new girl
And she's looking pretty fine
But sometimes she don't listen to me
And it makes me wanna lose my mind
Like you used to
I tried to blame it all on you
But I know that I'm to blame too

[Chorus: Bethany Consentino]
And I guess this is what they mean
When they say
People can change
'Cause I finally feel free
I feel like myself again
But for the first time

[Bridge: Bethany Consentino]
I used to think that I would die without you
And no offense to you but I'm doing fine too

[Outro: Bethany Consentino]
'Cause finally I'm free
I feel like myself again
But for the first time
And no offense to you but I'm doing fine too
But for the first time
Yeah, for the first time
Yeah, for the first time
