[Intro: Usher & Lil Jon]
Peace up, A-Town down
Yeah! Okay
Lil Jon
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's go!

[Verse 1: Usher & Lil Jon]
I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (okay!)
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out!)
Ohh! (watch out)
She's saying, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her (let's go!) I said

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: Usher & Lil Jon]
She's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (hey!)
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3: Ludacris & Lil Jon]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol (let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Outro: Ludacris & Lil Jon]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (clap)
Take that, rewind it back

Rock a way, rock a way, rock a way, rock a way and cut!

Right Where You Want Me - Radio Edit Version,Jesse McCartney,"

[Verse:]
Girl there's something about me that you outta know
I've never felt the need to lose control
Always held on back and played it slow
But not this time baby don't be gentle
I can handle anything

[Chorus:]
Baby take me on a journey
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy let's do something maybe
Please don't take your time
You got me right were you want me
Whooa
Right where you want me

[Verse 2:]
Girl I'm gonna let you have your way with me
When you move like that it's hard to breathe
I never thought that it could be like this but I was wrong
Baby don't be gentle I can handle anything

[Chorus:]
Baby, take me on a journey
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy let's do something maybe
Please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me

[Bridge:]
Can't explain it how you swept me off my feet unexpectedly
In slow motion my imagination's running trying to keep my body still ooh
I can hardly stand the thrill, yeah!!
Baby don't be gentle I can handle anything

[Chorus:]
Baby, take me on a journey
I've been thinking lately I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy let's do something maybe
Please don't take your time
You got me right where you want me
Baby take me on a journey
I've been thinking lately
I could use a little time alone with you
Crazy let's do something maybe
Please don't take your time

Year 3000,Jonas Brothers,"

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
One day, when I came home at lunchtime
I heard a funny noise
Went out to the backyard to find out if it was
One of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Peter
And a Flux Capacitor

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He took me to the future in the flux thing
And I saw everything
Boy bands, and another one, and another one
And another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars
Float above the floor

[Pre-Chorus 2: Nick Jonas]
We drove around in a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah, woo

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Bridge: Nick Jonas & Joe Jonas]
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
It had outsold Kelly Clarkson
I took a ship to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our seventh album
(Seventh album, seventh album)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nick Jonas]
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen, yeah

[Breakdown: Nick Jonas]
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, oh

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000 (Yeah, yeah)
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine, doing fine

[Chorus: Nick & Joe Jonas, and Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater (Oh, yeah)
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

[Outro: Nick Jonas]
He said, I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed, but they lived underwater
And your great-great-great-granddaughter
Is doing fine, doing fine

Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, ""What a beautiful lady""

Your Love Is My Drug,Kesha,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe I need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
I'm seeing it in my dreams
I'm looking down every alley
I'm making those desperate calls
I'm staying up all night hoping
Hitting my head against the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Verse 2]
Won't listen to any advice
Momma's telling me I should think twice
Better left to my own devices
I'm addicted, it's a crisis
My friends think I've gone crazy
My judgment's getting kinda hazy
My steeze is gonna be affected
If I keep it up like a lovesick crackhead

[Pre-Chorus]
What you've got, boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
I'm all strung out, my heart is fried
I just can't get you off my mind

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Bridge]
I don't care what people say
The rush is worth the price I pay
I get so high when you're with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

[Verse 3]
Hey, so I got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do I make your heart beat like an 808 drum?
Is my love your drug? Your drug
Huh, your drug
Huh, your drug
Is my love your drug?

[Chorus]
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
Because your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love
I said your love, your love, your love is my drug
Your love, your love, your love

[Outro]
Hey
Hey, so...
Your love, your love, your love, your love is my drug
I like your beard

[Intro]
Closer
Closer
Closer
Closer

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

[Pre-Hook]
Come closer
Come closer

[Hook]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

[Verse 2]
I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me

[Pre-Hook]
Come closer
Come closer

[Hook]
And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
And I just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop
I just can't stop

[Interlude 1]
Come closer
Come closer
Come closer
Come closer

For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, ""It's time to sink or swim,""
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, whoa oh
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby listen...

I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love

Every day I bring the sun around
I sweep away the clouds, smile for me

Spend it like my last dime, step to the beat of my heart

I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine

[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh, woah
Oh, woah
Oh, woah

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said ""There’s another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you'd always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like...

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
(Luda)
When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

I'm gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, yeah yeah yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone, I'm gone

Ghost Love Score,Nightwish,"

[Verse 1]
We used to swim the same moonlight waters
Oceans away from the wakeful day

[Chorus]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever

(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me
I'll bleed forever

[Verse 2]
Scent of the sea before the waking of the world
Brings me to thee, into the blue memory

[Chorus]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever

(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
If you be the one to cut me, I'll bleed forever

Into the blue memory

[Verse 3]
A siren from the deep came to me
Sang my name my longing
Still I write my songs about that dream of mine
Worth everything I may ever be

[Verse 4]
The Child will be born again
That siren carried him to me
First of them true loves
Singing on the shoulders of an angel
Without care for love ‘n loss

[Bridge 1]
Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

Bring me home or leave me be
My love in the dark heart of the night
I have lost the path before me
The one behind will lead me

[Bridge 2]
Take me
Cure me
Kill me
Bring me home
Every way
Every day
Just another loop in the hangman’s noose

Take me, cure me, kill me, bring me home
Every way, every day
I keep on watching us sleep

Relive the old sin of Adam and Eve
Of you and me
Forgive the adoring beast

[Bridge 3]
Redeem me into childhood
Show me myself without the shell
Like the advent of May
I’ll be there when you say
Time to never hold our love

[Chorus 2]
(My fall will...)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever

(... be for you)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever

[Outro] (repeat until fade)
My fall will be for you
My love will be in you
You were the one to cut me
So I’ll bleed forever

I Will Show You,Ailee,"

내가 사준 옷을 걸치고
내가 사준 향술 뿌리고
지금쯤 넌 그녈 만나 또
웃고 있겠지
그렇게 좋았던 거니
날 버리고 떠날 만큼
얼마나 더 어떻게 더
잘 해야 한 거니

너를 아무리 지울래도
함께한 날이 얼마인데
지난 시간이 억울해서
자꾸 눈물이 흐르지만

보여줄게 완전히 달라진 나
보여줄게 훨씬 더 예뻐진 나
바보처럼 사랑 때문에
떠난 너 때문에 울지 않을래

더 멋진 남잘 만나
꼭 보여줄게 너보다 행복한 나
너 없이도 슬프지 않아 무너지지않아
Boy you gotta be aware

산뜻하게 머릴 바꾸고
정성 들여 화장도 하고
하이힐에 짧은 치마
모두 날 돌아봐

우연히 라도 널 만나면
눈이 부시게 웃어주며
놀란 니 모습 뒤로 한 채
또각 또각 걸어가려 해

보여줄게 완전히 달라진 나
보여줄게 훨씬 더 예뻐진 나
바보처럼 사랑 때문에
떠난 너 때문에 울지 않을래

더 멋진 남잘 만나
꼭 보여줄게 너보다 행복한 나
너 없이도 슬프지 않아 무너지지 않아
Boy you gotta be aware

니가 줬던 반질 버리고
니가 썼던 편질 지우고
미련 없이 후회 없이 잊어 줄 거야
너를 잊을래 너를 지울래

보여줄게 완전히 달라진 나
보여줄게 훨씬 더 예뻐진 나
바보처럼 사랑 때문에
떠난 너 때문에 울지 않을래

더 멋진 남잘 만나
꼭 보여줄게 너보다 행복한 나
너 없이도 슬프지 않아 무너지지 않아
Boy you gotta be aware

No Make Up,Zion.T,"

예쁘게 머리를 하고
오늘도 집을 나서는 넌 예뻐 (음?)
높은 구두를 신고
짧은 치마를 입고
있는 너 너무나 아름다워 (but)

넌 모를 거야
자다가 일어나 살짝 부은 얼굴이 얼마나 예쁜지
넌 모를 거야
자기 전 세수한 니 모습이 얼마나 (예쁜지)

자꾸 거울 보지마
몸무게 신경 쓰지마
넌 그냥 그대로 너무 예쁜 걸
No make up, yeah, no make up, yeah

빨간색 립스틱보다
투명한 립밤이 좋아
저 하늘 구름보다 자연스러워
어제도 힘들었는지
너무 지쳐 보여 너
이리 와서 내 품에 안겨 babe

[Pre-Hook]
넌 모를 거야
아이라인 없이 웃는 너의 예쁜 눈웃음을
넌 모를 거야
메이크업 베이스 지우면 빛나는 우유빛 피부

자꾸 거울 보지마
몸무게 신경 쓰지마
넌 그냥 그대로 너무 예쁜 걸
No make up, yeah, no make up yeah

Wedding Dress,TAEYANG,"

[Intro]
Some say, ""It ain't over ’til it's over,""
But I guess it's really over now
There’s something I gotta say before I let you go
Listen

[Verse 1]
네가 그와 다투고
때론 그 땜에 울고
힘들어할 때면
난 희망을 느끼고
아무도 모르게 맘 아, 아, 아프고
네 작은 미소면 또 담담해지고
네가 혹시나 내 마음을 알게 될까 봐
알아 버리면 우리 멀어지게 될까 봐
난 숨을 죽여
또 입술을 깨물어
제발 그를 떠나 내게 오길

[Hook]
Baby, 제발 그의 손을 잡지 마
'Cause you should be my lady
오랜 시간 기다려 온 날 돌아봐 줘
노래가 울리면
이제 너는 그와 평생을 함께하죠
오늘이 오지 않기를
그렇게 나 매일 밤 기도했는데
네가 입은 wedding dress (dress, dress)
Girl, 네가 입은 wedding dress (내가 아니잖아) (dress, dress)
Wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, 네가 입은 wedding dress
Oh no

[Verse 2]
내 맘을 몰라 줬던 네가 너무 미워서
가끔은 네가 불행하길 난 바랐어
이미 내 눈물은 다 마, 마, 마르고
버릇처럼 혼자 너에게 말하고
매일 밤 그렇게 불안했던 걸 보면
난 이렇게 될 거란 걸 알았는지도 몰라
난 눈을 감아, 끝이 없는 꿈을 꿔
제발 그를 떠나 내게 오길

[Hook]
Baby, 제발 그의 손을 잡지 마 (baby) (oh oh oh)
'Cause you should be my lady (lady)
오랜 시간 기다려 온 날 돌아봐 줘 (hey)
노래가 울리면
이제 너는 그와 평생을 함께하죠
오늘이 오지 않기를
그렇게 나 매일 밤 기도했는데
네가 입은 wedding dress (dress, dress)
Girl, 네가 입은 wedding dress (내가 아니잖아) (dress, dress)
Wedding dress (dress, dress)
Oh, 네가 입은 wedding dress
Oh no

[Bridge]
부디 그와 행복해
너를 잊을 수 있게
내 초라했던 모습들은 다 잊어 줘
비록 한동안은 나 죽을 만큼 힘이 들겠지만, no oh
너무 오랜 시간을
착각 속에 홀로 바보처럼 살았죠
아직도 내 그녀는
날 보고 새하얗게 웃고 있는데

[Hook]
네가 입은 wedding dress (oh no) (dress, dress)

Sea Song,Tears For Fears,"

[Verse 1]
You look different every time
You come from the foam - crested brine
It's your skin shining softly in the moonlight
Partly fish, partly porpoise, partly baby sperm whale
Am I yours? Are you mine to play with?

[Verse 2]
Joking apart, when you're drunk you're terrific
When you're drunk I like you mostly late at night - you're quite alright
But I can't understand the different you in the morning
When it's time to play at being human for a while

[Hook]
We smile
We smile
We smile

[Verse 3]
You'll be different in the spring
I know, you're a seasonal beast
Like the starfish that drift in with the tide, with the tide
So until your blood runs to meet the next full moon
Your madness fits in nicely with my own, with my own
Your lunacy fits neatly with my own, my very own
We're not alone

"
Looking out for You,Joy Again,"

I guess I should stop
Looking out for you
Like I always do
When will you
Start looking out for me too
Instead of leaving me
Staring at my shoes
It’s just the way you’re glancing at me
Something about you
Just makes me feel guilty for
Liking you
When you’re with him
When you’re with him

This is a love song for a girl
Who will never know it’s about her
I know it’s pretty stupid
But I’m much too shy to tell her
She’s beaming that smile
All the while
I’m all choked up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope

And we’re walking out in the snow
I say I guess I
Should go
And we’re talking ‘bout someone else
When we should
Be talking about ourselves
It’s the same old situation
You’ve always got me waiting
Come on dear I think times a wastin’
Before we have to go back inside
And return to our normal lives

This is a love song for a girl
Who will never know it’s about her
I know it’s pretty stupid
But I’m much too shy to tell her
She’s beaming that smile
All the while
I’m all choked up on my own throat
I guess there is no hope

"
Necromancer,Joy Again,"

Oh necromancer, put a spell on me
With kisses so sweet they rot my teeth

Oh necromancer, why are you so far away
Another day rolls by without me kissing your face

Oh girl, won't you meet me in the city
The street lights and corner store signs make you look so pretty

But when will you just be with me
I'm so infatuated, I'd swim across the sea

I guess you're just fading all away
And I guess I have nothing much to say

And you can call me and tell me if you're okay
I just wish I could see you every day

"
Mistakes,Joy Again,"

I can't remember all my mistakes
I'll stay forever if that's what it takes

(Think of the past)
Think of the past and you'll get sick of me
(It doesn't mat-)
It doesn't matter, laying in the meat

It's just a promise no one can make
Stealing from round here, there's not much to take

(Maybe I don't)
Maybe I don't know responsibility
(Maybe I'm done)
Maybe I'm done for, loving all my dreams
(Just trying to find)
I'm floating on the stormy sea
(I'm floating on)
Just trying to find something nice to eat

Strangest Eyes,Part Time,"

[Verse 1]
Hey little girl, you've got me wrapped up
In your mystery
We've known each other for, quite sometime
But still it's so hard to see

[Chorus]
Stranger's eyes, eyes
You've got them
Stranger's eyes, eyes
You've got them
Stranger's eyes, eyes
You've got them
Stranger's eyes, eyes
Stranger's eyes
You've got them
Stranger's eyes, eyes
You've got them
Stranger's eyes, eyes
Stranger's eyes, eyes

[Verse 2]
Under your skin it's easy to see
The things that you hide
Don't you worry 'bout, what I think
Tell me what's on your mind
I've got the feeling that there's something not right
'Cause you won't let me near
You take my hand, and you, show me love
But still, something's not here

It's Elizabeth,Part Time,"

Send up that phone, hey
It's Elizabeth
Let's share that thing that I love the best
All day when there's so much worry on my mind
Well, well, well

Hey, we can have fun
She said
Hey, it's Elizabeth
Got time to worry 'bout what I want next
No time for the rich
Look inside my mind
Yeah, yeah, yeah

There's something all around me
Something I can feel
Something complicates me
Is this feeling real?

I look at my phone, it's
Hey, it's Elizabeth
I think to myself
How much I love her best
Worry on my mind, yeah you weigh so heavy in the night
Well, well, well

I look at my phone
It's Elizabeth
You know I love her best
There's nothing else that matters
She's a [?]

There's something all around me
Something breaks my heart
I can't understand it
From the start

Pussy of my Dreams,Part Time,"

Not so long ago
I was a boy without a chance
My heart turned to rubble
With every girl that I'd meet

In all of my life
I wish you longed for my love
Who can give me endless pleasures
In ways I couldn't solve

I was searching in the city
Deserts high, coast to coast
When I saw your loving
With a face like a ghost

Spoke in many rhythms
'Til we held each other tight
She satisfies my every need
And pleases my appetites

[Chorus x3]
She's the pussy of my dreams
And it satisfies me all night
She's got the pussy of my dreams
I tell her it's all tight
You're the pussy of my dreams
And I will always treat you right

I Love Seattle,Tacocat,"

Did you hear that the world is ending?
Right here right where we stand
At least no one's pretending
Like that would even be bad

Uh oh, made it through the winter
Uh oh, summer too warm
I wouldn't live anywhere else but
Don't say you weren't warned

Ooooh, beautiful Seattle
Ah, fall into the sea
Earthquake, tsunami
There's still no place I'd rather be

Earthquake, tsunami
There's still no place I'd rather be

Can you see the world is ending?
Reptiles, take it in stride
It's still worth defending
Outside, yelling at the tide

Uh oh, top left-hand corner
Evacuation route
Hard science, hard changes
No substitute

Ooooh, beautiful Seattle
Ah, fall into the sea
Earthquake, tsunami
There's still no place I'd rather be

Earthquake, tsunami
There's still no place I'd rather be

Did you hear that the world is  ending?
Yeah, yeah, we already know
Where would you want to be
When the fault line goes

Uh oh, made it through the winter
Uh oh, summer too warm
I wouldn't live anywhere else but
Don't say you weren't warned

Ooooh, beautiful Seattle
Ah, fall into the sea
Earthquake, tsunami
There's still no place I'd rather be

Shapeshifters, programming
There's still no place I'd rather be

Dark as Days,Army Navy,"

Can we go
Cause I'm always searching for more
And it never makes it clear than it was before
I can see that the disco lights of the dreams
But we'll never dream of to make us tough

But I won't ever believe it till I melt inside
I won't ever be free until I let you die
Yeah I never believed in the power
It slips away
I always needed a plan to dislocate

I can see that you're probably springing from me
If your making a clear get away
My get away

But I won't ever believe it till I melt inside
I won't ever be free until I let you die
Yeah I never believed in the power
It slips away
I always needed a plan to dislocate

Yeah I never believed in the power
It slips away
I always believed when the nights are as dark as days

Yeah I never believed in the power
It slips away
I always needed a plan

Yeah I never believed in the power
It slips away
I always needed a plan to dislocate
Yeah I never believed in the power it slips away
I always believed when the nights are as dark as days

End It Now!,The Lonely Forest,"

What if I swallowed all these pills at once?
What if I'd never been born, what if Germany had won the war?

Maybe this plane is destined to crash
The pilot's perfect smile a wreck on the dash

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? I'm leaving it up to the skies

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?
Is there an end?

I've found the list of questions goes on, I think I might as well stop
Or I'll be questioning unanswerable 'til I drop
The scientist must lead a miserable life, studying gravity and infinite space
How much can one linear mind really know?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Is there an end?
Is there an end? I'm leaving it up to the skies

Is there an end?
Is there an end? Where are you?

Signs,Bloc Party,"

[Verse 1]
Two ravens in the old oak tree
And one for you and one for me
And bluebells in the late December
I see signs now all the time
The last time we slept together
There was something that was not there
You never wanted to alarm me
But I'm the one that's drowning now

[Verse 2]
I can sleep forever these days
Cause in my dreams I see you again
But this time-fleshed out fuller face
In your confirmation dress
It was so like you to visit me
To let me know you were okay
It was so like you to visit me
You're always worried about someone else

[Bridge]
At your funeral I was so upset
So, so upset
In your life you were larger than this
Statue statuesque

[Chorus](x2)
I see signs now all the time
That you're not dead, you're sleeping
I believe in anything
That brings you back home to me

"
Big Decisions,My Morning Jacket,"

[Verse 1]
Sit'n round wondering just what the hell to do with your life
Only get one chance but you seem to always think twice
And I'm getting so tired of trying to always be nice

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Cause I can't
Well I can't

[Verse 2]
I don't quite feel like faking it again tonight
Don't really feel like saying everything is alright

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Well I can't
Well I can't

[Bridge]
Go on do it
If you really, really mean it
Oh don't just hold back then regret it

[Pre-Chorus]
You're sweet and sincere, but so ruled by fear

[Chorus]
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
What do you want me to do?
Make all the big decisions for you?
Well I can't
Well I can't

Show me love
In the booty club
Private dance

Tidal wave, bad bitches offer drugs
I don't care
I'm just here to fall in love

Summer's eve
Summer breeze
Some are dressed pink flesh demon eyes
What's in my eyes [?]
Even when we find each other we deep in disguise
Tell me do you bring light right under my soul
Do you burn dark circles I feel outta control
I got baggage so do you
All the signals get confused
So we sippin' cold drank until the world feel you
Feel me?

[Hook]

How could I be the one
Many men text date throughout play
Sittin' alone, call into work, say you sick (sick)
Sick of nigga shit (shit)
Sick and tired, spent (spent)
Feeling lonely, why should I begin
So I can fill a void
Feel happy just like my friends (friends)
But inside they dying cause them drugs just kicked in

Now they wanna function

Life Is What You Make It,Antwon,"

[Verse 1: Antwon]
This that mixed race motherfucker, eating shrimp and ??? in town
You ain't my world, I ain't your kickstand
We was on the video games till we discovered weed
High as fuck playing GTA
My Auntie gave me the money, just to get something to eat
Cause my Moms didn't get paid till the end of the week
My favorite shit was to skate around the block
Moms would yell out the window if the street got too dark
My homie Ofido had the black box of Sega channels
I would walk to his house, summertime sandals
Used to dance around the house like I was Michael
Couldn't shoot the J's so I tried to dunk like Michael
I knew a kid named Bobby, he had a brother named Michael
Used to kiss the girls on the hands, by that motorcycle
I never knew what life had planned but what I know now, I understand, that

(Hook)
Life is what you make it
That life is what you make it
That life is what you make it
That life is what you make it

[Verse 2]
Young fat nigga buying clothes off the clearance rack
Double X, I guess I really like snacks
Soda was my shit until I started drinking
Give a fuck about nothing, what the fuck was I thinking
Probably make it in this rap biz, can I live?
Wanted to get laid but all the chicks was busy having kids
Parliament got men on the block going crazy, when he leave the spot the place probably 180
I remember when I first got my dick sucked, she was trying to front like saying her mouth ain't married
I was so damn careless, drunk at 16
Blacking out, even barfing in my sleep
Used to spange for the change just to get something to eat
Didn't want to go home, no longer my mommas baby
Trying to keep from going crazy
But maybe its my destiny, because

Baby Got Back,Sir Mix-A-Lot,"

[Intro: Girls]
""Oh, my, god, Becky, look at her butt. It is so big. She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends. Who understands those rap guys? They only talk to her, because she looks like a total prostitute, okay? I mean, her butt, it's just so big. Ugh, I can't believe it's just so round, it's like out there, I mean, ugh, gross. Look! She's just so black!""

[Verse 1: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face, you get sprung
Wanna pull up tough 'cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearin'
I'm hooked and I can't stop starin'
Oh, baby, I wanna get wit'cha
And take your picture
My homeboys tried to warn me
But that butt you got makes (me so horny!)
Oh, Rump-o'-smooth-skin
You say you wanna get in my Benz?
Well, use me, use me
'Cause you ain't that average groupie
I've seen 'em dancin'
To hell with romancin'
She's wet, wet
Got it goin' like a turbo 'Vette
I'm tired of magazines
Sayin' flat butts are the thing
Take the average black man and ask him that
She gotta pack much back
So, fellas! (Yeah!) Fellas! (Yeah!)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah!)
Tell 'em to shake it! (Shake it!) Shake it! (Shake it!)
Shake that healthy butt!
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
(L.A. face with a Oakland booty)
Baby got back!

[Verse 2: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
I like 'em round, and big
And when I'm throwin' a gig
I just can't help myself, I'm actin' like an animal
Now here's my scandal
I wanna get you home
And ugh, double-up, ugh, ugh
I ain't talkin' 'bout Playboy
'Cause silicone parts are made for toys
I want 'em real thick and juicy
So find that juicy double
Mix-a-Lot's in trouble
Beggin' for a piece of that bubble
So I'm lookin' at rock videos
Knock-kneed bimbos walkin' like hoes
You can have them bimbos
I'll keep my women like Flo Jo
A word to the thick soul sistas, I wanna get wit'cha
I won't cuss or hit ya
But I gotta be straight when I say I wanna *moan*
'Til the break of dawn
Baby got it goin' on
A lot of simps won't like this song
'Cause them punks like to hit it and quit it
And I'd rather stay and play
'Cause I'm long, and I'm strong
And I'm down to get the friction on
So, ladies! (Yeah!) Ladies! (Yeah)
If you wanna roll in my Mercedes (Yeah!)
Then turn around! Stick it out!
Even white boys got to shout
Baby got back!

[Chorus: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
Baby got back!

[Bridge: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
""Yeah, baby. When it comes to females, Cosmo ain't got nothin' to do with my selection. 36-24-36? Ha ha, only if she's 5'3"".""

[Verse 3: Sir Mix-a-Lot]
So your girlfriend rolls a Honda
Playin' workout tapes by Fonda
But Fonda ain't got a motor in the back of her Honda
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you've got buns, hun
You can do side bends or sit-ups
But please don't lose that butt
Some brothers wanna play that hard role
And tell you that the butt ain't gold
So they toss it and leave it
And I pull up quick to retrieve it
So Cosmo says you're fat
Well I ain't down with that!
'Cause your waist is small and your curves are kickin'
And I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin'
To the beanpole dames in the magazines:
You ain't it, Miss Thing!
Give me a sista, I can't resist her
Red beans and rice didn't miss her
Some knucklehead tried to diss
'Cause his girls are on my list
He had game but he chose to hit 'em
And I pull up quick to get wit 'em
So ladies, if the butt is round
And you want a triple X throwdown
Dial 1-900-MIX-A-LOT
And kick them nasty thoughts
Baby got back!

[Outro]
Baby got back!
Little in the middle but she got much back!

Peace up, A-Town down

Let's go!

[Verse 1: Usher & Lil Jon]
I was up in the club with my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key
You should know how it feels (hey!)
I seen shorty, she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she know me
I decided to chill (okay!)
Conversation got heavy
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow (watch out!)
Ohh! (watch out)
She's saying, come get me
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said, baby let's go
When I told her (let's go!) I said

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: Usher & Lil Jon]
She's all up in my head now, got me thinking
That it might be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave, ready to leave now (let's go!)
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a one to ten, she's a certified twenty
But that just ain't me (hey!)
Cause I don't know, if I take that chance
Just where's it gonna lead
But what I do know is the way she dance
Make shorty alright with me
The way she get low
I'm like, yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like, yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave
(Let's go, bring the beat back!) And I say

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me

Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Verse 3: Ludacris & Lil Jon]
Watch out, my outfit's ridiculous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And roar, these women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'ma milk the cow (yeah!)
And forget about game, I'ma spit the truth (what?)
I won't stop till I get 'em in their birthday suit (yeah!)
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off with their clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting, then I put em on foot patrol (let's go!)
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please (yeah!)
Ludacris fill cups like double D's (yeah!)
Me and Ursh' once more, and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed that say

[Chorus: Usher & Lil Jon]
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Shorty got down low said, come and get me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Her and my girl, they used to be the best of homies
(Yeah!) Yeah!
Next thing I knew, she was all up on me screaming
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!
Yeah (yeah!) yeah (yeah!) yeah, yeah!

[Outro: Ludacris & Lil Jon]
Take that and rewind it back
Lil Jon got the beat that make your booty go (clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ursher got the voice make your booty go (clap)
Take that, rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow to make your booty go (clap)

It's a long way down, we so high off the ground
Sending for an angel to bring me your heart
Girl, where did you come from? Got me so undone
Gaze in your eyes, got me saying, ""What a beautiful lady""
No ifs, ands or maybes
I'm releasing my heart and it's feeling amazing
There's no one else that matters, you love me
And I won't let you fall, girl (Fall, girl), let you fall, girl, oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
I won't let you fall, let you fall, let you fall, oh, oh-oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

For every ending, is mega starter
When they bring the dark
We bring the light, let's go

I Do,Colbie Caillat,"

[Verse 1]
It's always been about me, myself, and I
I thought relationships were nothing but a waste of time
I never wanted to be anybody's other half
I was happy saying I had a love that wouldn't last
That was the only way I knew 'til I met you

[Chorus]
You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Yeah, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I can live without it, I can let it go
Ooh what did I get myself into?
You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Verse 2]
Tell me is it only me
Do you feel the same?
You know me well enough to know that I'm not playing games
I promise I won't turn around and I won't let you down
You can trust I've never felt it like I feel it now
Baby, there's nothing, there's nothing we can't get through

[Chorus]
So can we say
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
I won't live without it, I won't let it go
What more can I get myself into?
You make me wanna say

[Bridge]
Meet my family, how's your family?
Ooh, can we be a family?
And when I'm eighty years old and I'm sitting next to you

[Chorus]
And we'll remember when we said
I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
Oh, baby, I do, I do, I do, do do do do do do do
'Cause every time before it's been like maybe yes and maybe no
No, I won't live without it, I won't let us go
Just look at what we got ourselves into
You make me wanna say
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
Love you

Crowded Places,Banks,"

[Intro]
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 1]
I wanna get you in my spaces
I wanna take you different places
I know the touring is romantic
I know you see me as a frantic girl
But I can give you what you want
I know you like the way I held my temper
When I gave you to the world, gave you to the world
I can be your heart to let go

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home

[Verse 2]
I know I messed with your head
It was just when I left you
When I was just blowing up when I said
""Remember when I loved you right before that tour?""
You said you didn't want to see me anymore
And then when I got home when I played that show in L.A
All your shit was gone
It was the only time I thought I'd made a mistake
And when I only want to hold you
I thought I wanted you to hold me

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
Come with me, I'll take you home

[Bridge]
It falls to death so talk with me
This life, what if it's you and me?
Don't know, oh no
Maybe that means we'll fall from grace
It'd be ok, I'd have your face with me
You'll see, you'll see, you'll see, you'll see

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
I've been scared of crowded places
'Cause I've been scared of crowded places
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I've been scared of crowded places

'Cause I've been scared of crowded places

13,LANY,"

[Verse 1]
It could change, but this feels like, like the calm before the storm
Not that I don't wanna try, but I've been here before
Friends in town, phone's at home, I tell myself it's fine
Can't remember how you taste, slept alone too many nights

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

[Verse 2]
Half my clothes are at your house, and I don't want them back
The smell of you is way too much, not gonna put my heart through that
I don't know how much time we got, I don't know how much to say
I don't know, tell me what you want, I want you to want me to stay

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong? I know we started out alright
Where did we go wrong? I swear I knew we'd last this time
Where did we go wrong? Oh did you, did you change your mind?
How could you change your mind?
Who got inside your mind?

Right now
You got me feeling like I can’t believe I let you go

To stay in time again

And you will leave me wanting more

Complication,Aquilo,"

[Verse 1]
They don't know I'm missing
I don't know my way around
All these thoughts they fit in
But I don't live on solid ground

[Pre-Chorus 1]
No patience in my mind
But the voices treat me kind, oh oh
I've got the shadows on my back
Telling me what it is I'm living for

[Chorus]
Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened to the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause I've been searching for a complication

[Verse 2]
Feel the courage kick in
As I go out and paint the town
'Cause we don't know the city
So we get drunk and we fall out

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I've got no patience in my mind
Will the voices treat me kind? No
I've got the shadows on my back
Telling me what it is I'm living for

[Chorus]
Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened with the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause what happened with the conversation?

[Outro]
Am I just another complication?
'Cause what happened to the conversation?
And I know that I can't talk, no
'Cause I've been searching for a complication

Reap,BASECAMP,"

I know you think you can't trust me
And I know that maybe you're right
Cuz I came and went
I left you again
With a wound you cannot hide

You caught me out in the open
You drew a bead on my heart
But you come and go
You reap what you sew
Never finish what you start

Motionless,Alpines,"

[Verse 1]
Restless in the thought of you break down
The empty truth, I'm floating in the moment
I've been sleeping when it's so fragile
Deep down in a place there's a part of you, is a part of me
Undefinable, hard to believe
I've been praying for you endlessly

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is timeless
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless
So love is timeless
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless

[Chorus]
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries

[Verse 2]
Graceless in the words I said I'm sorry
You know that you're everything to me
The way I feel, so plain
I'm exposing and devoting

[Pre-Chorus]
Love is timeless (fragile)
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless
So love is timeless (fragile)
We're moving
But we're motionless
We're motionless

[Chorus]
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries
And you've got this hold on me
And you've been breaking down the boundaries

We're motionless, we're motionless, we're motionless
We're motionless, we're motionless, we're motionless

Think About That,Jessie J,"

[Intro]
Mmm, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I've carried this load for way too long
I couldn't let you go, under a spell of don't, don't, don't
Ego reaction, guess I was holding up face
By saving your ass, you spent my money and I lost their faith

[Pre-Chorus]
I screamed, ""Yes,"" you told me, ""Nah""
You fed me fear, I spoke to God
I was living my dreams through your eyes
Building my life on your lies, yeah

Think about that
Who lives the real sacrifice?
Think about that
Think about that, huh
Think about
Think about that, wow

Years of grindin', you took it, you broke it and all 'cause you fake it
You wanna be famous, say it, you wanna be famous
Using my juice, was thirsty as fuck, always late, always faded

I screamed, ""Yes,"" you told me, ""Nah""
You fed me fear, I spoke to God

Think about that time when you blamed me
Think about that time when I called you up
And I said I needed saving
Think about that time when you said you cared
You were lying, tryna faze me (yeah, yeah)
Think about that time when I got sick
And you made me go on stage
And think about that time when you used my fate
To stack up on your paper (yeah)
Think about that time you told my label lies
You said, ""She's crazy""
Think about the fact they see it now (yeah)
You're a shark, a cheat, a traitor (a shark, a cheat, a traitor)

Left you lonely for the life that I had sold
Led a lie 'cause it was easier than going home, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And tell me, where do we go when this shit gets so real?
We can't find the words to say, I'm standing here in limbo

Watch you fade away until you had no more

Twice,Catfish and the Bottlemen,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't mind just getting high in mine
We're shouting over music with a friend who's like a brother
Because if I get time I'd just regret most shit

[Pre-Chorus]
From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide

[Chorus]
Christ, I ain't ever going back to thinking straight
Twice, twice it brought me down but it's the last time

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'll grow tired
Of you bitchin' all the time
'Cause when you love the way you’re living
It's just hard to fret about much
Because if I got time I just regret most of it

From every hangover my head feels
To every ex I didn't treat right
To every Monday I called in sick
To every argument I let slide

Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though but I always want to

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
I'd love you, but I need another year alone
I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

And I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna disappear for days

[Chorus 2]
I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through
I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another second to myself
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

[Chorus 3]
(I don't think through things, I never get time)
I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
('Cause I don't think things through)
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
(I don't think through things, I never get time)
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
('Cause I don't think things through)
But I never come close

"
Love Is Mystical,Cold War Kids,"

[Verse 1]
And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
'Cause I'm a red blooded man
When I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

[Outro]
To believe again
To believe again

Kathleen,Catfish and the Bottlemen,"

[Verse 1]
You're simpatico
And of all the lift-homes and all the mixed feelings
You're cuts above
And you don't own worries or a chest full of heartache
Yes I know
That I'll never work out exactly how you­'re thinking
But, let me know when I'm needed home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

[Chorus]
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me you know
He used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

[Verse 2]
It's impractical
To go out and catch a death with a dress­ fit for the summer
So you don't
Instead you call me up with a head full­ of filth
Yes I know
That I'll never acquiesce anything you're thinking
But let me know when I'm needed home

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd come
You can leather me with your lips

[Chorus]
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
When you are not in the mood
I've gotta give it to you
You give me problems
And made me give in to you
Our dealer hates me you know
He used to see her but she sold
Him off on down the river

Soundcheck,Catfish and the Bottlemen,"

[Verse 1]
Maybe I don't act the way I used to
Because I don't feel the same about you
In fact, that's a lie, I want you

[Interlude]
I raced through soundcheck
Just to meet you on your fag break and you convince me
To put life aside and want you

[Pre-Chorus]
If only for the sake of it I could chill you out
And drive us through the night to your sister's
You could fall asleep with my jacket as a cover
And wake up just to join me to smoke

[Chorus]
I wanted everything at once
'Til you blew me out my mind
Now I don't need nothing

[Verse 2]
Maybe I don't act the way I used to
Because I don't feel the same that I did
The fact that I lie is 'cause I want you

How it never left you much
And 'cause you grew up in a small town
You'll appreciate it more
When you're done figuring your life out
And everything's fine

Young Blood,Noah Kahan,"

[Verse 1]
Oh dear, oh dear, I’m sorry
That you grew up so soon
A cold year and no high school parties
I’ve been drinking alone
Oh, I’ve been drinking alone
So, don't fear, don’t fear their warnings
They’re bitterer than most
4 years of driving across the country
For empty seats at their shows
And they’ve been drinking alone

[Chorus]
So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You young, young blood
Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You young, young blood
You young, young blood
Young blood

[Verse 2]
So when you’re mad for no reason
At everything at once
And when you start overthinking
I’ll be drinking at home
Oh, I’ll be drinking at home

[Chorus]
So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You young, young blood
Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You young, young blood
You young, young blood
Young blood

[Bridge]
And if you want, I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
In the morning, I’m bullet proof
And if you want, I could tell the truth
That this life takes a toll on you
I spend nights stitching up the loose threads in my soul
In the morning, I’m bullet proof
In the morning, I’m bullet proof

[Chorus]
So, keep your time, keep your mind, keep it humble
Start your life in the middle of the jungle
You young, young blood
Rub your eyes, be surprised, keep hungry
Stay alive, try to lose all of your money
You young, young blood
You young, young blood
You young, young blood

Like I'm leaving town and won't be back around

Jack Daniel's,David Allan Coe,"

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been
That didn't do me wrong

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane
Since my baby's gone

Cigarettes and whiskey
Calm my shaking hands
I just lost a lover
To a one night stand

Something temporary
To late I had to learn
Someone from her past, sure it couldn't last
A bridge she couldn't burn

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been
That didn't do me wrong

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane
Since my baby's gone

Promises were broken
Dreams were left to die
Empty words were spoken
Tears were in our eyes

Something temporary
Those tears will fade away
Do the best you can, to help me understand
These games that people play

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You're the only friend there has ever been
That didn't do me wrong

Jack Daniel's, if you please
Knock me to my knees
You can kill this pain that's driving me insane
Since my baby's gone

Say Something (Featuring Drake),Timbaland,"

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 1: Timbaland]
It really sucks, but ever since I’ve been long gone
I traded in my señorita for a microphone
I hate the way you fell apart, girl, it's sad to see
Your life is good, but me and you it’s catastrophe
If I was unsuccessful, would you be satisfied?
I need a paramedic girl, I’m feeling paralyzed
If I could choose, you will always be a friend to me
The more money I made you acting like my enemy – it's crazy
I can’t help it if you feel ashamed
Thought the pressure would turn you into my diamond babe
How can something so familiar be so strange
Closest friends get estranged when the status change, ah
Is it my mistake, thinking that where I am and where you at?
And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that had my back
You were the perfect pair and now it seems that we don’t match
Is it the money, want me to give it back?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

[Verse 2: Drake]
I am the topic of conversation, this is celebration
Let's toast to the fact that I've moved out my mama's basement
To a condo downtown, 'cause it's all about location
I sit and drink wine and watch Californication, to life
You shoulda been here to kick it with me
We could have split this whole thing up 50/50
But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy
Killing shit, the ever-so talented Mr. Ripley
How I go from being the man that you argue with
To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit
I should wanna go back to the one I started with
But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit
Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along
You could tell me that you've never heard none of my songs
Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen
'Cause what's a star when it's most important fan is missing?

[Chorus: Drake]
This shit was all I knew, you and me only
I did it all for you, still you were lonely
We could've worked it out, uh, but I guess things change
It's funny how someone else's success brings pain
When you're no longer involved, that person has it all
And you just stuck standin' there but
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
Say-say something, baby
Say something, babe, say something
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby
I'm gon' need you to say something, baby, ohh-whoa

Uh, fuck, I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
You lil', you li' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic
Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick (brr brr)
I see you callin', I be makin' it quick
I'ma answer that shit like, ""I don't fuck with you.""
Bitch, I got no feelings to go
I swear I had it up to here, I got no ceilings to go
I mean, for real, fuck how you feel
Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill
Yeah, and every day I wake up celebratin' shit
Why? ‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch
I stuck to my guns, that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here
That's what made me this
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone
I got a bitch that text me she ain't got no clothes on
And then another one text, then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't fuck with you
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you

Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online
Limited amount of time, chasin' these dollar signs
And you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten
My niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless, you might end up domeless
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth
Why you always coming around with bad news?
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew
But them niggas cool, it's just that…

[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean + (E-40)]
Bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Lil biatch!)
You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you (Nuh-uh!)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
I got a million trillion things I'd rather fuckin' do
Than to be fuckin' with you, lil' stupid ass

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
I don't, I don't, I don't give a fuck
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about you
Or anything that you do
Don't give a fuck about you, or anything that you do

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for
Yeah, I got a lot but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up
That shit can break you down if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious
Feel me when you get a fine bitch
Just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma's too real
So I hope you doin' cool, but still…

[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' with you
Little stupid ass… I ain't fuckin with…
I ain't fuckin'… I ain't, I ain't fuckin' with you
I ain't fuckin' with you (Straight up)

Twice,Little Dragon,"

[Verse 1]
Twice I turn my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn't lose
Tell me where would I go
Tell me what led you on, I'd love to know

[Chorus]
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now

[Verse 2]
Thought I had an answer once
But your random way swept me along
Colossal signs so I got lost
With so many lovers singing songs

[Chorus]
Was it the blue night, gone fragile?
Was it about the men, in wonder steady going under?
Was it the light ways, so frightening?
Was it a two wills?
One mirror holding us dearer now

Show Your Love,DJ Cam,"

[Hook: Supastition]
No matter where you are
No matter where you're at
We're gonna resurrect the music and bring it back
No matter where you're at
No matter where you are
You gotta rock to it, Cam and Supa keep it raw

[Verse One: Supastition]
Repertoire forever, I'll be damned if I'mma change up
This therapeutic music, I use it to channel anger
At any given time, Supa's liable to spark shit
And we's wild, speed dial your fire department
Inform 'em, people wanted the flows hot now-a-days
I smell smoke in Carolina, there's a four alarm blaze
I had to prove that I'm nice and sick with it to the game
I refuse to kiss ass for some critical acclaim
Am I dope as they proclaim? You seen the way I stand my ground
When placed beside bigger niggas with a name
My sound ain't for the suburbanites
It's more for the homies on the grind within the urban life
9 to 5 worker type
I'm here to show my state and all tobacco and livestock
And you can see the difference in the rap flow that I got
There's no dispute about it, we the best in here
Breakin' new ground with the sound of yester year
Let's keep it rockin' y'all

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Supastition]
I'm a franchise player, y'all little dudes get benched
Even in Paris I'm the shit dawg, excuse my French
It's me and DJ Cam, forever we stay fam
Let's get this paper up front like it's a prepaid plan
Now it's official, Supastition keep it poppin' out in France
Other rappers? Not a chance
Brother, y'all can not advance
I spit with a heavy impact that'll break your bones
Got Carolina in my arms like ??
I'm that thorough
My colony is standin' right beside me son
Team players, never selfish like Iverson
Just give me some bass and the livest drums
I'll have you rushin' to the record store by the time I'm done
I bring back that old feel with no frills it's so real
It's the Suparemacy with DJ Cam on the wheels
There's no dispute about it, we the best in here
Breakin' new ground with the sounds of yester year
Let's keep rockin' y'all

[Hook]


[Bridge: Supastition]
No matter where you're at
No matter where you are
No matter where you're at
No matter where I am

I swear I'll solve your life, my feet fall over you inside
And I thought I heard someone say
You'll fly far away
And when you reach up the sky is there

[Verse 2]
This clueless, I wouldn't know
We swam in the waves, and we let it go
Until I heard someone say
Over the horizon beyond
Oh, where you reached and knocked over stars

[Chorus]
I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

[Verse 3]
Ooo, Ooo
Nothing can steal this treasure from us, babe
I'm still in love, now
Fighting the sounds
Take chances and come closer to me babe
I'm fallin' out, now

[Chorus]
I dreamt I came from parking movements
Every moment I see with our clothes
Take me to places where we can stop
I dreamt I came from parking movements

[Outro]
Now, Oooooo
Take chances and come closer to me babe
I'm fallin' out

Redeemed,DJ Shadow,"

God gave me a song that the angels cannot sing
I've been washed in the blood of the crucified one
I've been redeemed

God gave me a song that the angels cannot sing
I've been washed in the blood of the crucified one
I've been redeemed

Que Sera,Wax Tailor,"

[Intro]
A record of the delightful piece
They're going to play this evening

Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen
Ladies and gentlemen

Your attention please

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, the moment we've been waiting for is here
I- I have something to tell you

[Chorus]
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
(Remember) Will be
(Remember) Will be

[Verse 1]
The future's not
The future's not
The future's not

I believe in the future (I believe in the future)
I don't believe in miracles
Can it be true?!
It must be true, no doubt! (no doubt!)

Life is going on as normally as ever
But suddenly something seems to have happened
(Suddenly something seems to have happened)
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction
People seem to be frightened, even terrified

I want everybody to understand this
I don't understand
I don't understand
There're a lot of things we don't understand either
(understand, either)

We need answers from you
What- What did you expect to find?
(What did you expect to find?)
What is going to be our future?
It-  It's your responsibility to do something about it!
Well, I, uh...
I have the key in my hand
All I have to find is the lock
Now listen to me, all of you!

[Chorus]
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Que sera, sera
Whatever will be
(Remember!) Will be
(Remember!) Will be

[Outro]
Oh, you're divine

Listen,DJ Shadow,"

Well it's hard when it matters
To make the right move
The bright lights
Shining right into your face

That's when you need a little distance
And you take a little time
Time enough to fell what's really yours
And what you feel is really mine
And this time you stop and Listen

And you try but there's never a time just to listen
Then you find that there's never a time just to listen

Well you need a little patience
Just to step back and beat them frown lines that are
Written all over your face
No I see a tale within the motions
That your eyes can't see
So blind but in your mind is
No other place you'd be
And you ask a question to yourself when you have to sit down and

And you find but there's never a time just to listen
This is the time
Then you find that there's never a time just to listen
They won't hurt you anymore
And you try but there's never a time just to listen
It won't hurt you anymore
Then you find that there's never a time just to listen
Sit back, sit down, Listen

Cover My Eyes,La Roux,"

[Verse 1]
No wonder I'm scared to look in your eyes
You've turned me away so many times
You can take it away at any given moment
It's hard to believe while you're in this disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying

[Chorus]
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)

[Verse 2]
No wonder it hurts to sit by your side
(Turned me away so many times)
There's a different song I can play you tonight
(We don't have to sit here in silence)
We can break the pattern, we can change the colour
(It's just a little sacrifice)
You don't need to worry about the others
(It's all in your mind)

[Pre-Chorus]
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
I'm just surviving
So would you hold me please?
I'm trying hard to breathe
Stop me from crying

[Chorus](x2)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)

Something inside me dies

[Chorus](x2)
When I see you walking with her
I have to cover my eyes
(I have to cover my eyes)
Every time you leave with her
Something inside me dies
(Something inside of me dies)

Something inside me dies

Closer,Goapele,"

[Intro]
Closer to my dreams
It's coming over me
I'm getting higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm getting higher and higher
Feel it in my sleep

[Verse 1]
Sometimes it feels like I'll never go past here
Sometimes it feels like I'm stuck forever, ever (Like I'm stuck forever)

[Chorus]
But I'm going higher
Closer to my dreams
I'm going higher and higher
I can almost reach

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you just have to let it go (Let it go, let it go)
Leaving all my fears to burn and die
Push them all away so I can move on
Closer to my dreams
Feel it all over my being, in my being
Close your eyes and seek what you believe

[Chorus]
I'm moving higher, higher, oh, oh
I'm going higher and higher and higher and higher
Closer to my dreams
(Higher and higher, oh, oh)

[Verse 3]
I'm moving upward and onward and beyond all that I could see
(Stretching out my arms so I can reach)
I'm so close it's like I can just reach
I can feel my dreams
Closer to my dreams
I'm moving closer to my dreams
Ooh

[Outro]
Sometimes it feel like you'll never gonna change
(Never gonna change)
But you never choose to walk away

"
Hell Is Round The Corner,Tricky,"

I stand firm for our soil (a source)
Lick a rock on foil (nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me, (They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in Stussy
Hell is round the corner where I shelter
Ism's and schisms, we're living helter skelter (been livin' on a study)
If you believe and (or) deceive common sense says shouldn't receive
Let me take you down the corridors of my life
And when you walk, do you walk to your preference?
No need to answer till I take further evidence
I seem to need a reference to get residence
A reference to your preference to say
I'm a good neighbor, I trudge, (shrug)
So judge me for labor
Live version of the song. The bond on me ensures (lobotomy) my good behavior
The constant struggle (strum) ensures my insanity
Passing the ignorance ensures the struggle for my family
We're hungry beware of our appetite
Distant drums bring the news of a kill tonight
The kill which I share with my passengers
We take our fill, take our fill, take our fill

I stand firm for our soil (a source)
Lick a rock on foil (nigga I'll come forth)
Say reduce me, seduce me, (They juice me, seduce me)
Dress me up in Stussy

Confused by different memories
Details of Asian remedies
Conversations, of what's become of enemies
My brain thinks bomb-like
So I listen he's a calm type
And as I grow, I grow collective
Before the move sit on the perspective
Mr. Quaye (Mr. Kray) lay in the crevice. (Distant cradle in the crevice)
And watches from the precipice
Imperial passage
Heat from the sun some days slowly passes
Until then, you have to live with yourself
Until then, you have to live with yourself

"
Fiction,The xx,"

[Verse 1]
Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
I wake up alone, with only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us, tonight comes, too long
We'll be torn apart by the break of day
You're more than I can believe
Would ever come my way

[Verse 2]
Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
Come real life, why do I refuse you?
Cause if my fear's right, I risk to lose you
And if I just mind and wake up alone
Bring on the night

[Verse 3]
Fiction when we're not together
Mistaken for a vision, something of my own creation
An uncertain haze, how am I to tell?
I know your face all too well, still I wake up alone
Fiction when we're not together

"
You Know You Like It,AlunaGeorge,"

[Verse 1]
Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't lay, letting my life get away

[Pre-Hook]
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done

[Hook]
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?

[Verse 2]
If you wanna train me, like an animal
Better keep your eye on my every move
There's no need to be so damn cruel
Baby you got nothing to prove

[Pre-Hook]
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come, if they bring me down
Life can be cruel, if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun, don't tell me what can't be done

[Hook]
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but it drives you insane
You know you like it but you're scared of the shame
What you want, what you gonna do?
You know you like it but it drives you insane
Only because you know that you wanna feel the same
You know you like it but it drives you insane
What you want, what you gonna do?

New Soul,Yael Naim,"

[Chorus: Yael Naim]
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

[Verse 1]
I'm a young soul in this very strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit bout what is true and fake
But why all this hate?
Try to communicate
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la...

[Bridge]
This is a happy end
Cause' you don't understand
Everything you have done
Why's everything so wrong
This is a happy end
Come and give me your hand
I'll take your far away

[Chorus]
I'm a new soul
I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take
But since I came here
Felt the joy and the fear
Finding myself making every possible mistake

His Daughter,Molly Kate Kestner,"

[1. Verse]
""Everything's gonna be alright.""
She whispers to herself
She was only 6 years old that night
As she hid behind that shelf
Cause daddy had a little too much to drink
And mama didn't want her to feel the pain she felt
But she still felt the pain...

Well, 10 years they came and went
And dad was gone
So she looked for love in other men
And tried to act strong
Oh, broken hearts and Scars in only places she could see
Cause she just wanted, she just wanted to feel something

[1. Bridge]
And as she sat there on that bed
Thinking 'bout what those girls said
Tears streamed from her eyes
She cried...

[1. Chorus]
""If there's a God out there
Please hear my prayer
I'm lost and I'm scared
And I got nowhere else to go
I've come a long, long way
But I'm not sure I can make it much farther...
So if you're listening, could you give a helping hand
To your daughter?""

[2. Verse]
Well, her path started to change
She reached out and grabbed God's grace
And finally, she saw a light
Until that night...
Where she decided one drink was alright
And one thing led to another
The next thing you know, 9 months go by
She's a mother

[2. Bridge]
And as she laid there in that bed
Stroking that small angel's head
Tears streamed from her eyes
She cried...

[2. Chorus]
""If there's a God out there
Please hear my prayer
I'm lost and I'm scared
And I got nowhere else to run
I've come a long, long way
But I'm not sure I can be the best mother...
So if you're listening, could you give a helping hand
To your daughter?""

[3. Verse]
Well that baby grew into a boy
Who became her pride and joy
He loved her like no man could
And her heart felt peace, cause she finally understood
God's love

[3. Bridge]
So, as she laid there in that bed
99 years old
She grabbed her son's hand and said
""There's something you must know...""

[3. Chorus]
""There is a God out there
Who heard my prayer
I was lost and afraid
And I had nowhere else to go
I had no clue, what to do
And then he sent me you

So if you're lost and afraid
And you feel so alone
Don't worry child
Cause there's a Father who will love you as his own
Just like he loved his daughter
Like he loved his daughter

It's All Been Done,Barenaked Ladies,"

[Verse 1]
I met you before the fall of Rome
And I begged you to let me take you home
You were wrong, I was right
You said goodbye, I said goodnight

[Chorus]
It's all been done
It's all been done
It's all been done before

[Verse 2]
I knew you before the west was won
And I heard you say the past
Was much more fun
You go your way, I go mine
But I'll see you next time

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And if I put my fingers here, and if I say
""I love you, dear""
And if I play the same three chords
Will you just yawn and say

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Alone and bored on a thirtieth-century night
Will I see you on The Price Is Right?
Will I cry? Will I smile?
As you run down the aisle?

[Chorus]

"
Loser,Beck,"

[Verse 1]
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a monkey
Butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie
With the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables
Dog food skulls with the beefcake pantyhose
Kill the headlights and put it in neutral
Stock car flaming with the loser in the cruise control
Baby's in Reno with the vitamin D
Got a couple of couches, sleep on the love-seat
Someone came in saying I'm insane to complain
About a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt
Don't believe everything that you breathe
You get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve
So shave your face with some mace in the dark
Saving all your food stamps and burning down the trailer park
Yo, cut it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Double barrel buckshot)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

[Verse 2]
The forces of evil in a bozo nightmare
Ban all the music with the phony gas chamber
'Cause one's got a weasel and the other's got a flag
One's on the pole, shove the other in a bag
With the rerun shows and the cocaine nose-job
The daytime crap of the folksinger slob
He hung himself with a guitar string
A slab of turkey-neck and it's hanging from a pigeon wing
You can't get right if you can't relate
Trade the cash for the beat for the body for the heat
And my time is a piece of wax falling on a termite
Who's choking on the splinters

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Get crazy with the cheese whiz)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Drive-by body pierce)

[Bridge]
(Yo, bring it on down)

I'm a driver, I'm a winner
Things are gonna change, I can feel it

[Chorus]
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(I can't believe you)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?
(Sprechen Sie Deutsch, eh, baby?)
Soy un perdedor
I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me?

She Talks To Angels,The Black Crowes,"

[Verse 1]
She never mentions the word ""addiction""
In certain company
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphan
After you meet her family

She paints her eyes as black as night now
Pulls those shades down tight

Adam's Song,blink-182,"

[Verse 1]
I never thought I'd die alone
I laughed the loudest, who'd have known?
I trace the cord back to the wall
No wonder it was never plugged in at all
I took my time, I hurried up
The choice was mine, I didn't think enough
I'm too depressed to go on
You'll be sorry when I'm gone

[Chorus 1]
I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd die alone
Another six months I'll be unknown
Give all my things to all my friends
You'll never step foot in my room again
You'll close it off, board it up
Remember the time that I spilled the cup
Of apple juice in the hall
Please tell mom this is not her fault

[Chorus 1]
I never conquered, rarely came
16 just held such better days
Days when I still felt alive
We couldn't wait to get outside
The world was wide, too late to try
The tour was over, we'd survived
I couldn't wait 'til I got home
To pass the time in my room alone

[Chorus 2]
I never conquered, rarely came
Tomorrow holds such better days
Days when I could still feel alive
When I can't wait to get outside
The world is wide, the time goes by
The tour is over, I've survived
I can't wait 'til I get home
To pass the time in my room alone

Far Behind,Candlebox,"

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway

And then maybe some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway

And so maybe your friends they stand around they watch you crumble
As you fall down to the ground

And then somedayyour friends they stand beside as you were flyin'
Oh, you were flyin' oh so high
But then someday people look at you
For what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then someday we can take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now I'm saying, maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn't share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I lived with what I've known

And then maybe we might share in something great
Won't you look at where we've grown
Won't you look at where we've gone

And then someday comes, tomorrow holds
A sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon
You should have told me, hey
Hey but you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain, no, no, no

Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no, no, no, no
Oh my lord
See I know
See I know

But maybe, said maybe
I didn't mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway, sayin' now maybe
Some would say you're left with what you had
But you couldn't share the pain
Now I've said, but times have changed
Your friends they come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer, yeah they hold you down, hold on down
Now I said maybe, maybe
I didn't mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind

December,Collective Soul,"

[Verse 1]
Why drink the water from my hand
Contagious as you think I am
Just tilt my sun towards your domain
Your cup runneth over again

[Chorus]
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Why follow me to higher ground
Lost as you swear I am
Don't throw away your basic needs
Ambiance and vanity

[Chorus]
Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

December promise you gave unto me
December whispers of treachery
December clouds are now covering me
December songs no longer I sing

Don't scream about, don't think aloud
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Turn your head now baby just spit me out
Don't worry about, don't speak of doubt
Turn your head now baby just spit me out

Sugarhigh,Coyote Shivers,"

They all said ""she's just another groupie slut""
And I said I thought you were anything but
Think again, sometimes reputations outlive their applications
And sometimes fires don't go out, when you're done playing with them
I feel so funny deep inside
When you kiss me goodbye

Sugarhigh.....sugarhigh

We could go out and not even leave the house
A t.v. set and a bottle of wine is just fine
Making out on that old pull out couch
Watching saturday night live, I guess that's why
I feel so funny deep inside
When I lick between your thighs

Sugarhigh.....sugarhigh

Alright

And I have searched both far and wide
And I've explored the deepest caverns of my mind
To try and find an explanation why
I get this funny feeling deep inside
When you kiss me goodbye
And when I lick between your thighs

Sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh.....sugarhigh

Hey Man,Filter,"

[Verse 1]
I wish I would've met you
Now it's a little late
What you could've taught me
I could've saved some face
They think that your early ending was all wrong
For the most part, they're right
But look how they all got strong

That's why I say, hey man, nice shot
Good shot, man
That's why I say, hey man, nice shot

Hey man, have fun
Nice shot

[Verse 2]
Now that the smoke's gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear
You'd fight and you were right
But they were just too strong
They'd stick it in your face
And let you smell what they consider wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
That's why I say, hey man, nice shot
Good shot, man
That's why I say, hey man, nice shot
What a good shot, man

[Chorus]
A man has gun
Hey man, have fun
Nice shot
A man has gun
Hey man, have fun
Nice shot, man
Nice shot, man

[Outro]
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I'd say, nice shot

"
Follow You Down,Gin Blossoms,"

[Verse 1]
Did you see the sky, I think it means that we've been lost
Maybe one less time is all we need
I can't really help it if my tongue's all tied in knots
Jumping off a bridge, it's just the farthest that I've ever been

[Chorus]
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace, but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far

[Verse 2]
I know we're headed somewhere, I can see how far we've come
But still, I can't remember anything
Let's not do the wrong thing and I swear it might be fun
It's a long way down when all the knots we've tied have come undone

[Chorus]

Whoooo!

[Verse 3]
How you gonna ever find your place
Runnin' in an artificial pace
Are they gonna find us lying face down in the sand
So what the hell, have we already been forever damned?

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
Anyplace, but those I know by heart
Anywhere you go, I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)
I'll follow you down, but not that far (follow you down)

Coffee,Sylvan Esso,"

[Produced by Sylvan Esso]

True, it's dance, we know the moves
The bow, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news

Wrap me in your arms
I can’t feel it but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing

Wild winters, warm coffee
Mom’s gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the general attention
And stop, see the mix won't work
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

My baby does the hanky-panky, baby
My baby does
(Rock me)
My baby does the hanky-panky, baby
(In your arms)
My baby does

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the general attention
And stop, see the mix won't work
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment’s the same but the pair of feet change

Wolf,Sylvan Esso,"

[Produced by Sylvan Esso]

The modern wolf
He's kinder
But see him weep
It's a reminder

Don't wear no suit
We're talking t-shirts
See how he glides
Makes women shiver

Ah-woo
Ah-woo

He ain't no Jack
His voice is smoother
Been bending notes
Just like his father

Ah-woo
Ah-woo

But no birds or beast does he eat
He only wants the tenderest meat
And oh the sounds he makes them speak
Under all different patterns of sheets

Colors blind
Oh dopamine
And she looked so good when they were last seen

Ah-woo
Ah-woo

The modern wolf
The modern wolf
Drippin' in all the lives he took
He'll go on home
Try to wash them off
But when he shaves he hears them call

Ah-woo
Ah-woo

"
Uncatena,Sylvan Esso,"

[Produced by Sylvan Esso]

I'm washing
With all my friends
In the kitchen
Drying dishes
Turning twisting
Until we can run out
Going swimming
I feel you behind me
Ringing bowls right next to my ear
Tone was so clear
So that we all could hear
When the water washed around us
Salty
Holding us dear

Did you ever say it?
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No, no, no, no

Skinny skinny skinny man
With a whale to hold his hand
Oh to trade the places fast
To be swallowed
Let it last
Let it last
Let it last
Let it last

I'm swimming with all my
Slippery beginnings
White linen, sheet twisting
Limbs clenched so hard
Mouth so resistant

Did you ever say it ?
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No
Oh no
Did you ever say it?
No, no
Oh no

“All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time”
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time
All I want from you’s a letter
And to be your distant lover
That is all that I can offer at this time

"
Amsterdam,Gregory Alan Isakov,"

All inside our Amsterdam she hides
Watery-eyed
That howling wind, she's waving hi
Her other hand's in mine

Oh oh silhouette
She's growing tall and fine
She's got my back
She'll follow me down every street
No matter what my crime

All inside our Amsterdam she flies
Hoarding the kites
That howling wind, she'll take everything
But she's easy on the eyes

Oh churches and trains
They all look the same to me now
They shoot you some place
While we ache to come home somehow

"
Modern Girl,Sleater-Kinney,"

[Verse 1]
My baby loves me, I'm so happy
Happy makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a TV
TV brings me closer to the world

[Chorus]
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Was like a picture of a sunny day

[Verse 2]
My baby loves me, I'm so hungry
Hunger makes me a modern girl
Took my money and bought a donut
The hole's the size of this entire world

[Chorus]
My whole life
Looks like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Looked like a picture of a sunny day

[Verse 3]
My baby loves me, I'm so angry
Anger makes me a modern girl
Took my money, I couldn't buy nothin'
I'm sick of this brave new world

[Outro]
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day
My whole life
Is like a picture of a sunny day

There's A Girl In The Corner,The Twilight Sad,"

You're not coming back
You're not coming back from this

She's not coming back
She's not coming back from this

There's a girl in the corner and she's crying for you
Gonna die for you

She's not coming back
She's not coming back from this
We're not coming back
We're not coming back again

You said you'd leave me and I won't forget
I'm holding on and I'll see how far
You thought you loved me but you'll just forget
You're holding on but not too far

You're not coming back
We're not coming back from this

To all the boys you know
They all belong outside, outside, outside

She's not coming back
She's not coming back again

You dare not
You said you failed
You dare not

You sold me
You saved me

Where Is My Mind? - MTV Unplugged,Placebo,"

[Intro]
We're now going to do a cover version of a band that was hugely influential on me as I was growing up as a teenager. The band is called The Pixies. And the song is about how I often feel

[Verse 1]
With your feet in the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, Yeah
Your head will collapse, like there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

[Chorus]
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Way out, in the water see it swimmin'

[Verse 2]
I was swimmin' in the Carribean
Animals would hide behind the rocks, Yeah
Except the little fish
But he told me east was west
Tryin' to talk to me lover

[Chorus]
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out, in the water see it swimmin'

[Verse 3]
With your feet in the air, and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, Yeah
Your head will collapse like there's nothing in it
And you'll ask yourself

[Chorus]
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind
Where is my mind

Way out, in the water see it swimmin'

Hands Down,Dashboard Confessional,"

[Verse 1]
Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep
This air is blessed, you share with me
This night is wild, so calm and dull
These hearts, they race, from self control
Your legs are smooth as they graze mine
We're doing fine, we're doing nothing at all

[Chorus]
My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury
Or wear as jewelry whichever you prefer

[Verse 2]
The words are hushed, let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here, undiscovered
Safe in here from all the stupid questions
""Hey, did you get some?""
Man, that is so dumb
Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some

[Chorus]
My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst, to break or bury
Or wear as jewelry, whichever you prefer

[Outro]
Hands down, this is the best day
I can ever remember
I'll always remember the sound
Of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked
So I jumped it and I let you in
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it
That you meant it, that you meant it
And I knew that you meant it
That you meant it

"
Friend Hospital,Nada Surf,"

[Verse 1]
We are traveling daily by the hour
Moods clouding mountains, ideas like towers
Choosing sides, digging in, then changing
Hearts and mind are chafing from all the rearranging

[Chorus]
So much better that we're not together
Cause I will not lose you
Or be the blues to you
Friend hospital
Wild sadness knew weakness

[Verse 2]
I wish the sun would come through the walls
And find you wherever when you call
Give you the time and the will that you want
When you finally learn you can't always get what you haunt

[Chorus]
So much better that we're not together
Cause I will not lose you
Or be the blues to you
Friend hospital
Wild sadness knew weakness
Wild sadness knew weakness

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Awkward limo, fantastic cemetery
Reading from a list of your greatest hits
You're dropping them all the time
It's like landing on my favorite planet
When you're crackling through the line
So glad you called
Sharp advice saves my life

[Chorus]
So much better that we're not together
Cause I will not lose you
Or be the blues to you
Friend hospital
Wild sadness knew weakness
Wild sadness knew weakness
Wild sadness knew weakness
Wild sadness knew weakness

"
Love Is Mystical,Cold War Kids,"

[Verse 1]
And when my heart won't break
An empty space between my lungs
And when my knees won't shake
I'll drink to find inspiration
'Cause I'm a red blooded man
When I can't see behind the sun (I can't see behind the sun)
A supernatural plan
Is coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm a rational man
And I can see how far I've come (I can see how far I've come)
But I don't know where to stand
Or who's coming to meet me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Living life with no need for the brakes
Something happens when I lean on my mistakes
If the words are true
And the words reveal the same
I come alive when I don't even think

[Chorus 1]
Love is mystical
Love will break the chains
You might feel invincible
And you might be afraid
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again

[Bridge]
Oh, can't you hear the future is calling
For heaven's sake
It's either hell or high water
Let's get outta this place
I feel your skeptical eyes
On my mental state
I lift my hands to the sky
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes, oh yeah
And I lower the stakes

[Chorus 2]
Love is mystical
Do you feel the same?
Love is irresistible
It's calling out your name
Light in darkness will show you the way
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again
Give you the power to believe again

[Outro]
To believe again
To believe again

"
Jackie And Wilson,Hozier,"

[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Wake Me Up - Acoustic,Aloe Blacc,"

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

[Beat Break + Harmonies]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is a prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

Amsterdam,Imagine Dragons,"

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry, mother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine; no, these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry, brother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine; no, these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried, but I keep coming up short

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry, lover, I'm sorry I bring you down
Well, these days I try, and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery, and then I thought it wasn't meant to be
You said yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations, you are all alone!""

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

[Bridge]
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say
That I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
Your time will come
If you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me
I've tried

[Outro]
But I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, start crashing down
No, I won't wait much longer
'Cause these walls, start crashing down
And I keep coming up short

Tiptoe,Imagine Dragons,"

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

[Verse 2]
From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

[Bridge]
Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else...

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher

You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe

So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe

Anything you're trying to say to me

Something I Need,OneRepublic,"

[Verse 1: OneRepublic]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn’t lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you’re like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Verse 2: OneRepublic]
Last night I think I drank too much
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey don’t you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us

And if you only die once
I wanna die with

You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

This time now

You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

My Best Friend,Tim McGraw,"

[Verse 1]
I never had no one, that I could count on
I've been let down so many times
And I was tired of hurtin', so tired of searchin'
Till you walked into my life
It was a feeling, I'd never known
And for the first time, I didn't feel alone

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend
You're my best friend, oh yeah

[Verse 2]
You stand by me, and you believe in me
Like nobody ever has
When my world goes crazy, you're right there to save me
You make me see how much I have
And I still tremble, when we touch
And, oh, the look in your eyes, when we make love

[Chorus]
You're more than a lover, there could never be another
To make me feel the way you do
Oh we just get closer, I fall in love all over
Every time I look at you
And I don't know where I'd be, without you here with me
Life with you makes perfect sense
You're my best friend, ooh-oh oh

She sits quietly there
Black water in a jar
Says, Baby why are you
Trembling like you are

Together in this brief eternity
Summer days, winter snows
She's all things to behold

Like love from a drunken sky
Confetti falling
Down all night
She's my kind of rain

Fourth Of July,Fall Out Boy,"

You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 1]
I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too

I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Verse 2]
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night

It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

[Bridge]
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love

[Chorus]
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July

Woooo, woooo, woooo

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long (For too long)
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch (Out the touch)
I feel the rush and it's amazing

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & The Weeknd]
Maybe I’ve been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all (Want it all)
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way (Out of its way)
'Cause I know, all I know, all I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd & Lana Del Rey]
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I’m a prisoner to my addiction
I’m addicted to a life that’s so empty and so cold
I’m a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo

[Outro: Lana Del Rey]
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams

Cold Fame,Band Of Skulls,"

[Verse 1]
What's the point of fame if it's been abused?
What's a kid like me even got to lose?
Here I am on your bed again
It's too big for the room it's in
Wash your face and mouth just a little bit
Everybody knows that you're good at it
But nothing hurts like an answer phone
Drinkin' some, waking up alone
Maybe if I try just a little more
I can take myself from this dirty floor
Walk through buildings of elegance
Just like you are intelligent

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I fall from grace with this microphone
How'd you find yourself if you never roam?
Certainly I'm indebted baby, certainly, certainly, yeah

[Chorus]
I know my place, but it don't know me
I know my place, but it don't know me

[Verse 2]
No one wants to hear that you're breaking up
It wasn't long ago we said ""start me up""
Now all your dreamin' will have to wait
What you deserve you'll anticipate
Play your 45 records late at night
Open all the windows, turn out the light
Mysterious creatures will fill the room
A midnight show just put on for you

[Pre-Chorus]
But still I fall from grace with this microphone
How'd you find yourself if you never roam?
Certainly I'm indebted baby, certainly, certainly, yeah

[Chorus]
I know my place, but it don't know me
I know my place, but it don't know me

[Outro]
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me (I know my place)
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me (I know my place)
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me (I know my place) (But it don't know me)
Cold fame in my brain, but it's okay 'cause I know it's the best for me (I know my place) (But it don't know me)

Things Behind The Sun,Nick Drake,"

[Verse 1]
Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?

[Verse 2]
Look around, you'll find the ground
Is not so far from where you are, but don't be too wise
For down below they never grow
They're always tired and charms are hired from out of their eyes
Never a surprise

[Chorus]
Take your time and you'll be fine
And say a prayer for people there
Who live on the floor
And if you see what's meant to be
Don't name the day or try to say
It happened before

[Verse 3]
Don't be shy, you learn to fly
And see the sun when day is done, if only you see
Just what you are beneath a star
That came to say one rainy day in autumn for free
Yes, be what you'll be

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Please beware of them that stare
They'll only smile to see you while your time away
And once you've seen what they have been
To win the earth just won't seem worth your night or your day
Who'll hear what I say?

[Chorus 2]
Open up the broken cup
Let goodly sin and sunshine in
Yes, that's day
And open wide the hymns you hide
You find renown while people frown
At things that you say
But say what you'll say

[Outro]
About the farmers and the fun
And the things behind the sun
And the people around your head
Who say everything's been said
And the movement in your brain
Sends you out into the rain

Time Has Told Me,Nick Drake,"

[Verse 1]
Time has told me
You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

[Verse 2]
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For someday our ocean
Will find its shore

[Chorus]
So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love

[Verse 3]
Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

[Verse 4]
Your tears, they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

[Verse 5]
And time will tell you
To stay by my side, oh
To keep on trying
'Til there's no more to hide

[Chorus]
So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

[Verse 6]
Time has told me
You're a rare, rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

[Verse 7]
And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore

Going Under,The Dodos,"

This takes us by surprise I'm sure
Are you the curse? are you the cure?
Sometimes you know you ask too much
Been getting good at giving up
This ship is going under, going under, going under
Cast off, but hit the ocean floor
Misguided thread, he'll want your pores
I see you there upon a bluff
You disappear a tiny dot
This ship is going under, going under, going under
Misplace my heart, misplace my hope
Im here without it
Contained at home to all the brave
And bold who found it
To know you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
I hope you will, doing it once, I know you will, I've only begun
Give all my things, to all my enemy's are grounded
I make amends, I gave it up, I hope you found it
I see you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
To all of them, doing it once, I hope you know, I've only begun
Oh
To all the gold, my hands are up, I hide my plunder
Goodbye to everyone I know, were going under
I see you still, I hold you in, I hope you know, I only begin
To all of them, doing it once, I hope you know, I've only begun
Oh

Pale Blue Eyes,The Velvet Underground,"

Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby you just make me mad

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 2]
Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
Thought of you as everything
I've had but couldn't keep
I've had but couldn't keep

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 3]
If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in the mirror
I put in front of me
I put in front of me

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 4]
Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
She said, ""Money is like us in time
It lies but can't stand up
Down for you is up""

[Chorus]
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

[Verse 5]
It was good what we did yesterday
And I'll do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin

Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Lake Michigan,Rogue Wave,"

Heaven is a switchboard that you want to fight
She would even miss you if you taught her sight
Power politician leaning to the right
Baby's got a trust fund

[Chorus v1]
That she'll want to go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack

Now we wear same-colored yellow uniforms
Sky is burning, but at least we know we're warm
Go and run yourself a million miles
Hoping that the colors run out

And you go off like that
Get off of my stack
Leave a little window
Get off of my stack

Ringing all around it
You can never see yourself

1904,The Tallest Man On Earth,"

Well some they say it’s not even funny
And there you stand, not even trying
They say it is in line with the aging
Sometimes noise is just your mind
But the lesson is vague and the lightning
Shows a deer with her mind on the moor
And now something with the sun is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And as I lower down I hear it’s a message
And it’s 1902 just telling people to get out
And if there was a just a way I could tell them
It’s been long, but you are right
And the singing is slow and so quiet
Like the sound when you sweep off the floor
And now something with the dirt is just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And when the night is young
But the bridge is up
Something passing by our shore
And the only one you can tell it to
Well it's the only one that ever knows

And since one rock was made to go through my window
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
And you’re living with no light or direction but damn precise
And now you know
When believing is hard but you go now
And you feel what you drag across the floor
Because something with these trails are just different
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And when the night is young
But the bridge is up
Something passing by our shore
And the only one you will tell it to
Well it's the only one who'll ever know

And some will say it’s not even healthy
But body is young and mind is sure
That something is alright with your thinking
Because they shook the earth in 1904

Fortune - iambic Remix,Little Dragon,"

Mountain of pearls to sooth the soul
Gold and silver and silk to cover the old
Clocks and rubies crushing these hard bones
I'm going blind from to many shiny stones

Fortune cast a curse, I knew it would
Fortune bury you, I knew It would

Sleep on ugly dreaming wave
Vivid life turn into gray
No friends wanna stay around
So moving on to a different part of town

Fortune cast a curse, I knew it would
Fortune bury you, I knew it would

Get Right,Megafaun,"

Turning down lines at the drop of a dime again
Dressing up lies in the hollow dead skies a trend
Original Sin has a presence in everything
Better get right or hope that you can pretend
I try to settle down but I never seem to find a way
Try to let you know that I think about you everyday
Try to be clear but the sentiment goes away
And it's long overdue
I thought it would die but it grew
Said this before there's a lesson in store I'm sure
Broken heart stories and our broken heart metaphors
I'll tell you that I'm coming
Tell you I won""t be long
By the time I arrive there are clouds in the sky and you're gone
I try to do right but I never seem to find a way
I try to be on time but I never seem to know the place
I try to bring it up girl, I never meant to make you wait
I did it again, I got everything that I gave

Hell,Parlovr,"

In a bright, white aeroplane
Tapping your fingers on a windowpane
In your seat like a black statue
You wish you wasn't but you is aren't you
And his mind game corners you
You thought it was a lie
But you made it the truth
In your seat like a black statue
You wish you wasn't but you is aren't you?
Hell, heaven
Leave it to the men with the weapons
I've been wasting time trying to decide
You've got no choice you've got to stay
And the clouds are turning into your mothers face
In your seat like a white statue
You wish you wasn't but you is aren't you
And you relieve her of her veil
What happened to you next you couldn't tell
In your seat like a white statue
You wish you wasn't but you is aren't you?
Hell, heaven
Leave it to the men with the weapons
I've been wasting time trying to decide

Down In The Valley,The Head and the Heart,"

I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade
Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days

Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways

Call it one drink too many
Call it pride of a man
But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand

Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin
Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin

We do it over and over and over again
We do it over and over and over again

And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
Down in the valley with
Whiskey rivers
These are the places you will find me hidin'
These are the places I will always go
These are the places I will always go

I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way back to where I started

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

One more for the stars and the eyes of the walls
I saw your face, I heard you callin' out

I saw your face in the crowd and you came out
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

There was a sign on the door and it reads to me
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way back to where I started

California, Oklahoma
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
Down in the valley with
Whiskey rivers
These are the places you will find me hidin'
These are the places I will always go
These are the places I will always go

So I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade

The Stage,Avenged Sevenfold,"

[Verse 1]
So I arrived, naked and cold
A welcomed change from the abeyance of a ghost town catacomb
No need for counsel, I appreciate the time, I'm not alone
(Why don't you get my lawyer on the phone?)
There were days these child eyes
Would overlook the ugliness and fantasize
I found my heart for the first time and I awakened in me
I left myself to navigate and oh I felt control
(It seems these sheep have quite an appetite)

[Chorus 1]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?

[Verse 2]
As the boy became a man
In came a calm sophistication I can hardly understand
So lost in ego, didn't notice when the time had slipped away
(Yeah, everybody's got a sob story)
Jesus Christ was born to die
Leave it to man to levitate his own to idolize
We're simply sociopaths with no communication, baby
I see your angle but we differ from our points of view
(So tell me, what's your cross to bear?)

[Chorus 2]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

[Bridge]
Hope my wheels don't abandon me now
Seein' that I'm out here alone
I'm runnin' out of fight
And the wind speaks a comforting voice
Guiding me to her arms
Mother, I'm alright
It took the birth of sin to snake-rattle the mind
Before a blow to the head
By the gavel of time to wake up
Won't you wake up?
When did the walking apes decide that nuclear war
Was now the only solution for them keeping the score?
Just wake up
Can't you wake up?
(You do know this is just a simulation, don’t you?)

[Chorus 2]
Who is the crowd that peers through the cage
As we perform here upon the stage?
Tell me a lie in a beautiful way
I believe in answers, just not today

If I Fall,Five Finger Death Punch,"

I owe you nothing
I've given everything and more
I stand for something
The blood on my hands; the broken bones, I live it

[Pre-Chorus]
Knife in my back, you can't take it back
Eye for an eye is cut and dry
I'll do what I know, reap what I sow
While you're waiting for me to fail

[Chorus]

If I fall, if I fall
I'm dragging everybody down
If I fall I will take everybody down
(If I fall)
If I fall, if I fall
I'm taking everybody out
If I fall I will take everybody down

[Verse 2]
I'm not a voice of reason
Never been too big on fate
Seeing is believing
You run from it all, you stumble and crawl, I hate it

[Pre-Chorus]
Knife in your back, I won't take it back
Live and let die, the art of a lie
You do what you know, you reap what you sow
I'll be waiting for you to fail

The Unforgiven II,Metallica,"

[Verse 1]
Lay beside me, tell me what they've done
Speak the words I want to hear, to make my demons run
The door is locked now, but it's open if you're true
If you can understand the me, than I can understand the you

Lay beside me, under wicked sky
Through black of day, dark of night, we share this paralyze
The door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through
Black heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining through
No, there's no sun shining...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 2]
Come lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear
She loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again
She lay beside me, But she'll be there when I'm gone
Black heart scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone
Yes, she'll be there when I'm gone
Dead sure she'll be there...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
Sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there, because I'm the one who waits for you
Or are you unforgiven too?

[Verse 3]
Lay beside me, tell me what I've done
The door is closed, so are your eyes
But now I see the sun, now I see the sun
Yes now I see it...

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?
Yeah!
What I've felt, what I've known
So sick and tired, I stand alone
Could you be there
Because I'm the one who waits, the one who waits for you, oh

[Chorus]
What I've felt, what I've known
Turn the pages, turn the stone
Behind the door, should I open it for you?

What I've felt...
What I've known...

[Outro]
I take this key (never free...)
And I bury it (never me...) in you
Because you're unforgiven too

Never free
Never me
Because you're unforgiven too
Oh, oh, oh

You're everything I need, together we're gold
My heart is sold to you
Saw you in the summer, your face came to life
You can be my lover, the skies are blue

Your voice that sound takes my body higher
Oh na na, oh na na

Wanna be your girl, not 'cause the mood is right
If I let you go inside, tomorrow, will you hide?
Will you be there for me when I need someone to hold?
Baby, don't misunderstand, I do want you for my man
I just need a little time, before I invest my love

[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you
I'll be right there for you

[Bridge: Priscilla Renea]
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love), waiting just for you
I’ve got all this love (All this love, all this love)

[Chorus: Priscilla Renea]
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you (Don't walk away)
Don't walk away, boy (Mmm, don't walk away)
My love won't hurt you (No, no)
Don't walk away, boy (Don't walk away)
I'll be right there for you
I'll be right there for you

Love More,Chris Brown,"

[Intro]
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it
'Til we get it
I'ma get it
'Til we get it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it’s never enough, I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain’t meant for us
Baby, you let go and I pull you back, I let go, you ain't having that

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, we be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on, doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That’s just how it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it, turn up

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Why is it all so complicated?
Baby this should be simple, it’s driving me mental
But when you back it up it really drives me crazy
And you know what I’m into, make me forget what we arguing about, ay

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, we be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on, doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, then I love you
That’s just how it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it (Oh now)
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it (We get it right)
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it (More)
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he don’t know me but he setting up to blow me, uh
Said my Twitter picture remind him of Naomi, uh
On the low I used to holla at his homie, uh
Fuck it, now I’m 'bout to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo come polly
He wanna fuck a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a muthafuckin' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in his Royce, the tone in his voice
Don’t want a good girl, naw, hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, p-p-p-pussy on W
Mouth on open, a-a-ass on smother you
A-a-ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine
Vroom, vroom, vroom, get gasoline
Could I be your wife? Naw, we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped, call me the Django

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' fuck some more, ‘til we get it
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it
'Til we get it right we gon’ fuck some more, I'ma get it
I'ma get it, 'til we get it, 'til we get it, I'ma get it

Where the bartender? Tell him bring more liquor

Where the bartender? Tell him bring more liquor

"
Wild Animals,Trampled By Turtles,"

There's another world, it's made for us
Trapped in bodies, they're made to rust
It's one that I can break right through
I am ready, how about you?

By the coming dark, we try to breathe
And this just can't be happening
We found everything we need
Buried deep beneath the leaves

I see the better part of you
I see the better part of you
But I'm a monster just like you
Wild animals it's true

"
Wait So Long,Trampled By Turtles,"

I could never pretend that I don't love you
You could never pretend that I'm your man
That's exactly the way that I want it
That's exactly the way that I am

And you call me in the morning with your troubles
Takin' it downtown every night
I could never place the stars at night above ya
I got my hands on the ground
And you know I'm right

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

It's a coffee stained earth ever time it happens
Laugh it up honey it ain't that bad
Any afterthought rose to recognition
Like every other coffin that I had

And your Buick broke down in Winnemucca
Fall to your knees and you pray to the lord
Then you take up hope at the politicians
Nothing happens in this burnt out town anymore

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

And your heart rolls on like a frozen freight train
You know that I help you if I can
But I'm just a raindrop in a river
Just a little itty-bitty grain of sand

And you know that I'm doomed to repeat this
With all the bad habits that I've learned
But it's better than your fire-borne fornication
And all the dirty money that you earn

You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long
You wait so long

"
All The Time,Bahamas,"

[Verse 1]
I got all the time in the world
Don't you want some of that?
I got all the time in the world
Don't you want some of that?
Don't you want some of that?
I would, if I were you

[Verse 2]
I had
All (all) the (the) time (time) in the world
You wanted none of that
I had
All (all) the (the) time (time) in the world
You wanted none of that
You wanted none of that
I would if I were you

[Verse 3]
Put my
Work(work) in (in) front (front) of my girl
There's something wrong with that
Put my
Work(work) in (in) front (front) of my girl
There's something wrong with that
Something really, really wrong with that
I know this to be true

[Outro]

"
The Wrong Year,The Decemberists,"

[Verse 1]
Grey Jane was a river child
Born down by the river wild
Said, ""Hey what I wanna be
Nobody's gonna intervene""

[Chorus 1]
And she wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

[Verse 2]
Could be that he's into you
Could be that the obverse is true
Struck down as a summer child
Ten steps just to run a mile

[Chorus 2]
And he wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

[Bridge]
The spirit's willing
(Ohhh)
The flesh is getting bored
(Ohhh)
The speaker's blaring
Out some long-forgotten chord
Some misbegotten, long-forgotten chord

[Verse 3]
Sing me some Eidolon
And I'll sleep all the winter long
Till then I can only be
Nobody's gonna intervene

[Chorus 1]
And she wants you
But you won't do
And it won't leave you alone
And the rain falls
On the wrong year
And it won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone

[Outro]
It won't leave you alone
It won't leave you alone
(Ahha)

"
Lake Song,The Decemberists,"

[Verse 1]
Down by the lake we were overturning pebbles
And upending all the animals alight
And I took a drag from your cigarette and pinched it
'Tween my finger and my thumb, till it had died
And the sun burned low on the radio

[Verse 2]
Say that you will, say you will or will you won't
Or you whatever you prevaricate your whole life, don't you?
This much I can say: I would've waited till the oceans
Fell away and all the sunken cities would reveal themselves to you
But you won't, will you? Because you never do
And the sun burned through sweet as honeydew

[Chorus]
And I, seventeen and terminally fey
I wrote it down and threw it all away
Never gave a thought to what I paid
And you, all sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me, you tethered me to you
The things you would, and the things you wouldn't do
To tell the truth I never had a clue

[Verse 3]
Now we arise to curse those young suburban villains
And their ill-begotten children from the lawn
Come to me now, and on this station wagon window
Set the ghost of your two footprints
That they might haunt me when you're gone
And when the light broke dawn, you were forever gone
But I remember you: you were full
You were full and sweet as honeydew

[Chorus]
And I, seventeen and terminally fey
I wrote it down and threw it all away
And never gave a thought to what I paid
And you, all sibylline, reclining in your pew
You tattered me, you tethered me to you
The things you would, and the things you wouldn't do
You noticed how I never had a clue, never had a clue
You were full and sweet as honeydew
You were full and sweet as honeydew

"
Make You Better,The Decemberists,"

[Verse 1]
I want you, thin fingers
I wanted you, thin fingernails
And when you bend backwards
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better

[Verse 2]
I'll love you in springtime
I lost you when summer came
And when you pulled backwards
I wanted to, I needed to
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better

[Chorus]
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around to make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better

[Verse 3]
I sung you your twinges
I suffered you your tattletales
And when you broke sideways
I wanted you, I needed you
Oh-oh, to make me better
Oh-oh, to make me better

[Chorus]
But we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day that you met her
And it'd make you better
Did it make you better?
Make you better, oh

[Bridge]
And all I wanted was a sliver to call mine
And all I wanted was a shimmer in your shine
To make me bright

[Chorus]
Cause we're not so starry-eyed anymore
Like the perfect paramour you were in your letters
And won't it all just come around and make you
Let it all unbreak you to the day you met her
But it'd make you better
It'd make you better, oh

"
Jackie And Wilson,Hozier,"

[Verse 1]
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine

[Verse 2]
She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And lord, she found me just in time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Verse 3]
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

[Chorus]
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

"
Believe,Mumford & Sons,"

[Intro/Segue]

[Verse 1]
You may call it in this evening
But you've only lost the night
Present all your pretty feelings
May they comfort you tonight
And I'm climbing over something
And I'm running through these walls

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Verse 2]
I had the strangest feeling
Your world's not all it seems
So tired of misconceiving
What else this could've been

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
Everything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

[Verse 3]
Say something, say something
Something like you love me
Less you want to move away
From the noise of this place

[Refrain]
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I believe
I don't even know if I wanna believe
Anything you're trying to say to me

[Bridge]
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind
So open up my eyes
Tell me I'm alive
This is never gonna go our way
If I'm gonna have to guess what's on your mind

Touch The Sky,Kanye West,"

[Produced by Just Blaze]

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Back when they thought pink Polos would hurt the Roc
Before Cam got the shit to pop
The doors was closed
I felt like Bad Boy's street team: I couldn't work the locks
Now let's go, take 'em back to the plan
Me and my momma hopped in that U-Haul van
Any pessimists, I ain't talk to them
Plus I ain't have no phone in my apart-a-ment
Let's take 'em back to the club
Least about an hour I stand on line
I just wanted to dance, I went to Jacob an hour
After I got my advance, I just wanted to shine
Jay favorite line: ""Dawg, in due time!""
Now he look at me, like, ""Damn, dawg! You where I am!""
A hip-hop legend
I think I died in that accident, ‘cause this must be Heaven

[Hook: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky
Gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day I die, I'ma touch the sky

[Post-Hook: Kanye West]
Now let's take them hi-ah-igh-igh-igh-ighhhh
(Top of the world, baby, top top of the world!)
A-la-la-la-lah-la-lahhhhh
(Top of the world, baby, on top of the world!)

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Back when Gucci was the shit to rock
Back when Slick Rick got the shit to pop
I'd do anything to say I got it
Damn, them new loafers hurt my pocket
Before anybody wanted K. West beats
Me and my girl split the buffet at KFC
Dog, I was havin' nervous breakdowns
Like ""Man, these niggas that much better than me?""
Baby, I'm goin' on an aeroplane
And I don't know if I'll be back again
Sure enough, I sent the plane tickets
But when she came to kick it, things became different
Any girl I cheated on, sheets I skeeted on
Couldn't keep it at home, thought I needed a Nia Long
I'm tryin' to right my wrongs
But it's funny them same wrongs helped me write this song

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Yes, yes, yes, guess who's on third?
Lupe steal like Lupin the 3rd
Here like ear 'til I'm beer on the curb
Peachfuzz buzz but beard on the verge
Let's slow it down like we're on the syrup
Bottle-shaped body like Mrs. Butterworth
But, before you say another word
I'm back on the block like I'm layin' on the street
I'm tryna stop lyin' like I'm Mumm-Ra
But I'm not lyin' when I'm layin' on the beat, en garde
Or touché, Lupe cool as the unthawed
But I still feel possessed as a gun charge
Come as correct as a porn star
In a fresh pair steps in my best foreign car
So, I represent the first
Now let me end my verse right where the horns are, like uh

[Hook 2: Kanye West]
I gotta testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky
You gon' touch the sky, baby girl, testify
Come up in the spot lookin' extra fly
'Fore the day you die, you gon' touch the sky

[Outro: Kanye West]
We back at home, baby!
Sky high, I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
I’m, I’m sky high!
Sky, sky high! I’m, I’m sky high!
Yeah, keep it rollin'!
Yeah, uh, feels good to be home, baby!
Feels good to be home!

Forever,Drake,"

[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib]

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure (yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

[Bridge]
How you feel about comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights, I know we only fuckin' out of spite
Cause your man don't do you right, do you right, I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory, things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man

[Chorus]
I just love when I'm with you, yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me baby, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it, they say it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
Nobody else's, yeah, this shit belong to nobody, it's yours
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours that's for sure, that's for sure

Degas Park,Kevin Abstract,"

[Intro]
Where do you go, where do you go
Where do you go when you turn your back?
I need me some more, I need me some more
I need me some more I don't know how to act

[Verse 1]
Baby, baby, looking all crazy
Sipping on something that’ll make you feel amazing
You came into my room saw the posters from the 80s
You ignore me daily
Threw me shade even after jamming tape that I made ya
Nothing really major
Madonna, Nirvana, a little Cyndi Lauper
Wanna play fake doctor, we can fuck to Mariah
You can call me Messiah like, like
But you won't give me no chance ho
That’s why I can’t stand hoes
Bro said keep yo pants on
Before you end up dancing
With a baby in a hospital
And a mother in law, and a brother in law
And a sister in law and a father in law
On god I would not mind that at all

[Chorus]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby I’m still calling
Ya daddy brought his gun out but I’m still knocking
The sun was coming back around but I’m still falling
Even though you do these things girl I know you want me

[Verse 2]
This little light of mine
Watch you until I go blind
Why you cheatin', why you lyin'
Girl you must be out yo mind
Plotting, scheming on the low
Lying, thieving, you so cold
Dreaming until we grow old
I know you hear me quit acting like you don’t
Hey, hey, girl lets go
Tell me little something that I’d like to know
Take me to a place that I’d like to go
We can stay here now the weather ain't that cold
Sing to me but use ya throat
Do that thing I know you hate
But your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, your ass, you know I love
Is ya down to the watch the sun rise
Is ya down to let me fuck ya right
Is ya ever gon call me back
Is ya daddy still mad at fact
I won’t move my car out the drive way
Give me head on the high way
Killed my best friend, me and my bae
Sitting sideways they don't like me

[Chorus]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby I’m still calling
Ya daddy brought his gun out but I’m still knocking
The sun was coming back around but I’m still falling
Even though you do these things girl I know you want me

[Outro]
I know you blocked my number baby, baby, baby I'm still calling
You love the green but the red look awesome
I love the sex but the head was awesome
Smoke filled the room we jammed Janis Joplin
I wanna hold until we go numb
I wanna cum until it's no fun
I want a gun just to own one
What if I took your heart and made a street
What if you burnt my soul instead of your weed
Why must you do things that always make me weak
Wipe the filth off of your palms inside your mother's sink
All the love that we kept, all the secrets too
The closets open, still room for me and you
There's a war outside, no love inside
There's a guy in my mind with a nine that shine
I hope he blast it
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything to open
Waiting on everything
On everything

Wake Me Up - Acoustic,Aloe Blacc,"

[Verse 1]
Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

[Beat Break + Harmonies]

[Verse 2]
I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans
I wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game﻿ made for everyone
And love is a prize

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

[Outro]
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost
I didn't know I was lost

[Chorus]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know﻿ I was lost

Free,Donavon Frankenreiter,"

We could let this love be the fading sky
We could drift all night untill the new sun rise
Pass me a drink or maybe two
One for me and one for you

And we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee

Here comes corner winds and the changin' tide
We better drop them sails and get inside
When will the weather ever let us go
I guess we'll have to wait until the trade winds blow

When we'll be free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee

There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see
There's nothing in between
What we are, what we see, what we are
We are just

On a life boat sailin' home
With our drunken hearts and our tired bones
Well I just take one last look around
Yeah an' every place feels like a familiar town

And now we're free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
And dontcha wanna be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
From time to time a little
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
(hey now now)
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
I know you know your
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Feels so good to be
Free-ee-ee-ee-ee
Mmm mmm mmm

Song For Zula (Live From Spotify London),Phosphorescent,"

Some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just as fickle as a feather in a stream
See, honey, I saw love
You see it came to me
It puts its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing
See the cage, it called. I said, come on in
I will not open myself up this way again
Nor lay my face to the soil, nor my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, nor see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hands
You see the cage it called. I said, come on in
I will not open myself this way again
You see the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light
I might fear I go and my heart is white
And we race right out on the desert plains all night
So honey I am now, some broken thing
I do not lay in the dark waiting for day here
Now my heart is gold, my feet are right
And I'm racing out on the desert plains all night
So some say love is a burning thing
That it makes a fiery ring
All that I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer come to call from some awful dream
And all you folks, you come to see
You just to stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild, and my bones are steel
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free

Stolen Dance - Live From Spotify Berlin / 2014,Milky Chance,"

I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They've always been so kind
But now they've brought you away from here
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
Coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you
Suspense is controlling my mind
I cannot find the way out of here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
And I want you
We can bring it on the floor
You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it
Dancin' on do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise, shouldn't talk about it
Shouldn't talk about it

Isn't She Lovely,Stevie Wonder,"

[Verse 1]
Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love

[Verse 2]
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love

[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 3]
Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love

Momento,Bebel Gilberto,"

Bem tanta coisa é tão escondida
Que você não quer nem mais lembrar
Quem sabe talvez só você queira
Tanto tanto esconder

Tudo vai terminar
Tudo era um tormento
Deixa isso tudo passar
Vem viver este momento
Dos momentos (4x)

Agora não tem mais
Não tem mais nada que eu possa alcançar
Só dentro do meu peito
Eu quase paro
Eu não paro de me atormentar

Mas deixe isso tudo pra lá
Tudo era um momento
Deixe isso tudo lavar
Vem viver este momento
Dos momentos (3x)
Ah sim guarda (2x)
Para sempre sempre sim
Guarda (4x)
Dos momentos

Tudo vai terminar
Tudo era um momento
Deixe isso tudo pra lá
Vem viver este momentos
Dos momentos

Tem que reciclar (2x)
Deixe isso tudo pra lá (2x)

Blue Jeans,Lana Del Rey,"

[Verse 1]
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean (Oh-oh) and love hurts (Oh-oh)
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh baby), say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Verse 2]
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work""
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing (Oh-oh) paper (Oh-oh)
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh baby), say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

[Bridge]
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember

[Chorus]
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh baby), say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time

Young Hearts - The Chainsmokers Remix,Strange Talk,"

Remember when we were so small
And all the times we used to fall
You never walk before you crawl before you crawl
We wake up and we go to school
Together breaking every rule
They say that we're just young and fools, young and fools

Grown ups what do they know
Living by the stories on the radio
Bad news on the tv
Headlines are made of reality

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us we will carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us we will carry on

Remember all the memories
And every little fantasy
Careless about destiny, destiny
We don't have the time to sleep
There's every possibility
We have got a history, history

Grown ups what do they know
Living by the stories on the radio
Bad news on the tv
Headlines are made of reality

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us we will carry on

Carry on carry on
Wide awake and we're dreaming
Carry on carry on carry on carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us we will carry on

We're young hearts
Look at us go
All we really need is a stereo
We're young hearts
Look at us go
There's no stopping us we will carry on

Powerful (feat. Ellie Goulding & Tarrus Riley),Major Lazer,"

[Verse 1: Ellie Goulding]
Oh, my, my, my, what you do to me?
Like lightning when I'm swimming in the sea
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
Walking on wires and power lines
You put your body on top of mine
Every time that you lift me up
To the heaven and stars above

[Pre-Chorus: Tarrus Riley]
Oh, lord, have mercy, I'm begging you, please
I'm feeling drained, I need love
You charge me up like electricity
Jump-start my heart with your love

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Verse 2: Ellie Goulding]
I couldn't leave even if I wanted to
'Cause something keeps pulling me back to you
From the very first time we loved
From the very first time we touched
The stroke of your fingers, the scent of you lingers
My mind running wild, the thoughts of your smile
Oh, you gotta give me some
And you could give it all, but it's never enough, no

[Chorus: Tarrus Riley & Ellie Goulding]
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
There's an energy when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful
I can feel it when you hold me
When you touch me, it's so powerful

[Outro: Ellie Goulding]
Hold me in your arms
Burns like a fire, electricity
When you're close I feel the sparks
Takes me higher to infinity

This Joint,Slightly Stoopid,"

[Chorus] (x3)
The taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

[Verse 1]
Let's take a plane up out to Philly
We flying outta Dallas
Somewhere ???
Used to land on an empty chalice
Every land, we gon' play
An' I getting the weed from Cali
And rolling it up in Philly
Smoking weed up all day
We never seem to complain, really
And I really need to hear it
It a Kryptonite and don't you know
And we would not get near
No ordinary sensimilla
And the only thing they wanted
When the kryptonite is gone
We started smoking supersonic
If you got money to pay
Better put your money on it
A caption that go on and on and on and on
And a sight you never believe
What I'm smoking is 'semillia
No explanation needed
When I'm high, I don't conceal it
Everything is okay

[Chorus]
This joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

[Verse 2]
Smoked up all my weed from Philly
And everything from Cali
I'm all up in them palm trees
Smoking a pound of Maui-Wowie
Pakalolo, grade A
We go to the Caribbean
Deliver it up by the sea
Ya know connections get paid
Different strap for every season
If you really need a reason
We'd like the Kryptonite and an open red bull, lightin' b's
More than ounce or two of chronic
In the end it's what we needed
No one official type, pretender cut
Oh no, man, we'd say, ""come and let the music play""
Full volume, and repeat it
Perfection that go on and on and on and on
From here or Minnesota
From there onto Daytona
We came up in New York
Now up in Cali, so pro-bono
Everything is okay

[Chorus] (x3)
This joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali
Original, cutting the beat
And I getting all the weed
I said, taste of this joint
We rollin' it up in Philly
And I gettin' the weed from Cali

Oh, some people take it far
You need friction, but they try too hard and
Oh, they just don't understand
Too much pressure, it's supply demand

You open up my eyes, I'm alive
I'm moving to your rhythm and your vibe
I love it when the night is started

[Chorus: AlunaGeorge & ZHU]
Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic
Oh darling you are the only one, it's automatic
No one can love the way you do, it's automatic
When you walk in the room you change my mood, it's automatic
It's automatic, it's automatic

Been You,Justin Bieber,"

Feeling the reminisce
Gone in an instance
Blink of an eye
No goodbye
I had a notion
Deep as the ocean
Blue like the sky
Oh my

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
But we're the blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
(Woah, woah, woah)
If I had the chance
If I had the chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no
But if I
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
Been you

There repercussion
Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time

Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain

If I would have known

If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance

Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe

Separated from my ex
So we got closer
Oh, in every visit
Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

Strangers,Seven Lions,"

[Verse 1]
Nothing more than strangers
Passing by out on the street
Memories are fading though
It's only been a week
All the little things are gone
The things we used to be
Nobody could take us down
There was only you and me

And without you I can't be
You're the universe to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating

It's you
You
You
It's you, woah

You

You
It's you, woah

The things we used to be
Nobody can take us down there
It's only you and me

[Chorus]
And without you I can't be
You're the universe to me
You're the air in my lungs
You're the fields where I run
You're the sky where I'm floating

Unbelievable,Owl City,"

[Chorus 1]
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Verse 1]
When I was a kid I saved up all my dough so I could buy C-3PO
Put Mentos in my Diet Coke in the backseat of the bus
When I was a kid I ate ""Spaghetti Os"", played laser tag and GI Joe's
And if you vowed no girls allowed then you could join the club
When I was I was a kid I spent my Saturday's
Blowin' on Nintendo games
The newest thing was Lion King and I could feel the love

[Chorus 1]
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Verse 2: Hanson]
When I was a kid I dreamed of Power Wheels
Stayed up late watching action films
And I won't lie, my friends and I, were too legit to quit
When I was a kid I lived for climbing trees and Dr Pepper jellybeans
My favorite part of ""Jurassic Park"" was how real the Raptors looked
When I was a kid I still had VHS, watched Fresh Prince and Jazzy Jeff, Zack Morris owned the first cell phone, it was off the hook!

[Chorus 1]
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, it's unbelievable

[Bridge]
Gak, pogs, and floam and Home Alone, Berenstein bears and bean bag chairs
My L.A. Looks and Goosebumps books, oh Etch-a-sketch
What happens next?
Grape juicy juice and Dr. Seuss, piggy-back rides and
Slip-n-slides, McDonalds Fries, those were the best
What happens next?

[Chorus 2]
It's unbelievable
This is as good as it gets
It's unbelievable
Don't know what's gonna happen next
It's unbelievable
You haven't seen nothing yet
It's unbelievable, those were the days oh-oh

[Chorus 3]
It’s unbelievable
When I think back on my name
It’s unbelievable
Cause baby those were the days
It’s unbelievable
It ruled in so many ways
It’s unbelievable, it’s unbelievable

(Those were the days!)

Toothbrush,DNCE,"

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo, half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning, tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat, on repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

No need to question next time we meet
I know you’re coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna, break up the ice
I know you’re gonna stay the night, stay the night

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair and your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't want this to end
And there's no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus]
Baby, you don't have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place
We don't need to keep it hush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

[Post-Chorus]
I just, I just can't let you go, weird
Give me something I've never known
So, baby, you don't have to rush
You could leave a toothbrush at my place, at my place

I just know, I just know

And dance in your lap till you ready to pop

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]
Baby, you're so new age, you're like my new craze

The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move
Girl, you got me thinking 'bout all the things I'll do to you

From the couch to the counters in my kitchen

All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
(Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)

[Verse 2: Tyga & Chris Brown]
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply (No reply)
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me déjà vu
(Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa)
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now (Oh!)

No Love,Eminem,"

Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)

Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me

Work Out,J. Cole,"

[Intro]
I want to see you work out for me, work out for me

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 1]
She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced
Don’t overthink, just hope it's right
I’m only here for the night

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then

[Bridge]
Let me see you get high, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)
High, then go low
Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

[Verse 2]
Carolina Blue kicks, fresh on the scene
Hottest nigga on the block
Damn, girl, you're mean
They be startin' shit, but it’s yo' world
On my Martin shit: “You go, girl!”
She bad and she know it
Some niggas save hoes, I’m not that heroic
Could you be my escort?
'Cause just like them two door Fords
Damn, they don’t make 'em like you no more
Cole World, real Cole World
Them boys cool—me, I’m on fire
Know what's on my mind
Tryna see what's on yours tonight, tonight, tonight
Move slow, 'cause you wanna live fast
Up late so you'll probably skip class
Life is a test so before the night pass, get right, get right

[Chorus]
Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am
I know what's on your brain
You probably hoped it never would end
Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”
Well then (Cole World)

[Outro]
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
(Well, hey) Straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!
(Work out for me)
Straight up, now tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever? (Oh oh oh)
Or is it just a hit-and-run?
Well straight up, I tell ya
I just really wanna cut when we together (Oh oh oh)
Come here, girl, let's get it on!

Who Knew,P!nk,"

[Verse 1]
You took my hand, you showed me how
You promised me you'd be around
Uh-huh, that's right
I took your words and I believed
In everything you said to me
Yeah-huh, that's right

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong
I know better, 'cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Verse 2]
Remember when we were such fools
And so convinced and just too cool
Oh no, no no
I wish I could touch you again
I wish I could still call you friend
I'd give anything

[Chorus]
When someone said count your blessings now
'Fore they're long gone
I guess I just didn't know how
I was all wrong
They knew better, still you said forever
And ever, who knew?

[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah
I'll keep you locked in my head
Until we meet again
Until we, until we meet again
And I won't forget you my friend
What happened?

[Chorus]
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
'Cause they're all wrong and

[Outro]
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
And time makes it harder, I wish I could remember
But I keep your memory, you visit me in my sleep
My darling, who knew?
My darling, my darling, who knew?
My darling, I miss you
My darling, who knew?
Who knew?

I Drive Your Truck,Lee Brice,"

[Verse 1]
Eighty-nine cents in the ash tray
Half empty bottle of Gatorade rolling in the floorboard
That dirty Braves cap on the dash
Dog tags hangin’ from the rear view
Old Skoal can, and cowboy boots
And a Go Army shirt folded in the back

[Pre-Chorus]
This thing burns gas like crazy, but that’s alright
People got their ways of copin', oh, and I’ve got mine

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Verse 2]
I leave that radio playin'
That same ol' country station where ya left it
Yeah, man I crank it up
And you’d probably punch my arm right now
If you saw this tear rollin’ down on my face
Hey, man I’m tryin’ to be tough

[Pre-Chorus]
And momma asked me this mornin' if I’d been by your grave
But that flag and stone ain’t where I feel you anyway

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes
I drive your truck

[Bridge]
I’ve cussed, I’ve prayed, I’ve said goodbye
Shook my fist and asked God why
These days when I’m missin' you this much

[Chorus]
I drive your truck
I roll every window down
And I burn up
Every back road in this town
I find a field, I tear it up
'Til all the pain’s a cloud of dust
Yeah, sometimes (Brother, sometimes)
I drive your truck

[Outro]
I drive your truck
I drive your truck
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
I drive your truck

Drinking class,Lee Brice,"

We're up when the rooster crows
Clock in when the whistle blows
Eight hours ticking slow
And then tomorrow
We'll do it all over again

I'm a member of a blue collar crowd
They can never, no they can't keep us down
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me 'proud'

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We laugh, we cry, we love
Go hard when the going's tough
Push back on push and shove
Knock us down, we'll get back up again and again

I'm a member of a good timing crowd
We get rowdy, we get wild and loud
If you gotta, gotta label me
Label me proud

I belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us
Raise your glass
I belong to the drinking class

We all know why we're here
A little fun, a little music
A little whiskey, a little beer
We going to shake off those long week blues
Ladies, break out your dancing shoes

It's Saturday, it's Sunday
I just wanna hear you say
I just wanna hear you singing
Y'all Sing it with me

We belong to the drinking class
Monday through Friday, man
We bust our backs
If you're one of us

House Party,Sam Hunt,"

You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time

Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us

Leave The Night On,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

Lie a Little Better,Lucy Hale,"

[Verse 1]
I just missed my exit
Last night, I lost my keys
I'm fumbling over the words, I
Don’t feel a bit like me these days
I would be a liar
If I said I was fine
But I can't help being honest
And I know now is not the time 'cause

[Chorus]
The truth is, I'm falling to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is, the truth keeps slipping out
Can't seem to hide what I'm feeling
Can't believe what I'm saying out loud
Truth is, there's no turning back now
I guess I should've learned how to lie a little better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh

[Verse 2]
Been trying to cover
This heart out on my sleeve
Been set on playing this down, but
I think you're catching on to me

[Chorus]
The truth is, I'm falling to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is, the truth keeps slipping out
Can't seem to hide what I'm feeling
Can't believe what I'm saying out loud
Truth is, there's no turning back now
Well, I guess I should've learned how to lie a little better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh

[Bridge]
I'm losing this battle
With every word I say
Wish I had a better lesson
Of not giving myself away 'cause

[Chorus]
The truth is, I'm falling to pieces
Anytime that you're around
Trouble is, the truth keeps slipping out
Can't seem to hide what I'm feeling
Can't believe what I'm saying out loud
Truth is, there's no turning back now
Well, I guess I should've learned how to lie a little better
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, ohhh, oh

My heart's unconditional, yeah
You dress up just a little and I'm like, ""Oh, damn""

Mercy,Shawn Mendes,"

You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

[Verse 2]
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got

[Chorus]
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

[Chorus]
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging you

If I had it my way, I would take you down
If I had it my way, I would turn you out
And if my body had a say, I would come again
Scared of what I might say, cause I'm at the edge

Just what I want to

Mad World,Michael Andrews,"

[Verse 1]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow

[Hook]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world, mad world

[Verse 2]
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Hook]
And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very very
Mad world, mad world
Enlarging your world, mad world

I don't care, who you are, where you're from
What you did as long as you love me
Who you are, where you're from
Don't care what you did as long as you love me

[Verse 2: Brian with Kevin]
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like it's deep within me, ooh, ooh-ooh
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be

[Chorus: All & (Brian)]
I don't care, who you are, where you're from (Who you are, where you're from)
What you did as long as you love me (I know)

Don't care what you did as long as you love me (Yeah)
As long as you love me

[Bridge: Brian, All & Nick]
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows when you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're coming from
I don't care as long as you love me, baby
Woo, woo, woo, ooh

[Chorus: All]
I don't care, who you are, where you're from (Who you are, where you're from)
What you did as long as you love me (As long as you love me)
Who you are where you're from as long as you love me
Don't care what you did as long as you love me, yeah (As long as you love me)

[Outro: All]
Who you are (Who you are) where you're from
What you did as long as you love me
Who you are (Who you are) where you're from (Where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are, as long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me

Incomplete,Backstreet Boys,"

[Verse 1]
Empty spaces fill me up with holes
Distant faces with no place left to go
Without you within me I can't find no rest
Where I’m going is anybody’s guess

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

[Verse 2]
Voices tell me I should carry on
But I am swimming in an ocean all alone
Baby, my baby
It’s written on your face
You still wonder if we made a big mistake

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

[Bridge]
I don’t mean to drag it on, but I can’t seem to let you go
I don’t want to make you face this world alone
I want to let you go (alone)

[Chorus]
I tried to go on like I never knew you
I’m awake but my world is half asleep
I pray for this heart to be unbroken
But without you all I’m going to be is incomplete

Shape of My Heart,Backstreet Boys,"

[Verse 1: Brian]
Yeah, yeah
Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow (Glow, glow)
Hold me now don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, oh yeah

[Chorus: All]
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone
I played my part, kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness that's tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now, don't bother

Looking back on the things I've done

Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
I'll keep you in the dark (In the dark)
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
Looking back on the things I've done
I was trying to be someone (Trying to be someone)
I played my part, kept you in the dark

I'm with You,Avril Lavigne,"

[Verse 1]
I'm standing on the bridge
I'm waiting in the dark
I thought that you'd be here by now
There's nothing but the rain
No footsteps on the ground
I'm listening, but there's no sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I
I'm with you
I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I'm looking for a place
I'm searching for a face
Is anybody here I know?
'Cause nothing's going right
And everything's a mess
And no one likes to be alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Isn't anyone trying to find me?
Won't somebody come take me home?

[Chorus]
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are, but I

Maybe I'm just out of my mind

Put a Girl in It,Brooks & Dunn,"

[Verse 1]
You can buy you a brand new truck
Chrome it all out, jack it way up
You can build you a house up high on a hill
With a pool and a pond and a view to kill
You can make all the money in sight
But you ain't living the good life

[Chorus]
Until you put a girl in it
You ain't got nothin
What's it all worth
Without a little loving
Put a girl in it
Some huggin and some kissin
If you're world's got somethin missin
Just put a girl in it

[Verse 2]
You can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis
Have some fun in the sun, float around in the breeze
You can lay out on a blanket by the lake
Drink a cold beer, polish off another day
Kick on back and watch the sky turn red
A sunset ain't a sunset

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can write you a country song
The DJ won't put it on
They won't dance or sing along

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you're ridin in your truck
Put a girl in it
If you're going to have a party
Put a girl in it
If you want to live the good life
Better put a gir-r-rl in it

Day Drinking,Little Big Town,"

[Verse 1]
Everybody's always waiting on Friday
Watching that clock and sitting on go
Whatcha' say we find a little warm sunshine
An open umbrella on the patio
I don't need a reason or a happy hour
Ain't hangin' 'round for a fireworks show
Get a head start, a little sip of somethin'
Off and running, here we go
One, two, three, here we go

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

[Verse 2]
Blame it on the work day
Blame it on the heatwave
Blame it on the tick-tock movin' too slow
Blame it on any old thing you want to
Ready, get set, baby, here we go

[Chorus]
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

[Bridge]
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking
Day drinking, d-d-d-day drinking

[Chorus]
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling alright
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Don't wanna wait 'til the sun's sinking
We could be feeling all right
I know you know what I'm thinking
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?
Why don't we do a little day drinking?

Leave The Night On,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

House Party,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody

[Verse 3]
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

[Chorus]
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us

Someone New,Hozier,"

[Verse 1]
Go take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

[Verse 2]
There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do

[Pre-Chorus]
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way

[Chorus]
And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

[Bridge]
I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day...

[Refrain]
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

[Chorus]
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Everyday with someone new

Is there a chance that more than a dance could come from you
And tell me the truth one time

I Love You This Much,Jimmy Wayne,"

[Verse 1]
He can't remember the times that he thought
Does my daddy love me? Probably not
That didn't stop him from wishing that he did
Didn't keep him from wanting or worshipping him

[Verse 2]
He guesses he saw him about once a year
He could still feel the way he felt standing in tears
Stretching his arms out as far as they'd go
And whispering daddy, I want you to know

[Chorus]
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

[Verse 3]
He grew to hate him for what he had done
'Cause what kind of father could do that to his son?
He said 'damn you, daddy' the day that he died
The man didn't blink, but the little boy cried

[Chorus]
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

[Bridge]
Half way through the service
While the choir sang the hymn
He looked up above the preacher
And he sat and stared at him

[Verse 4]
He said 'Forgive me father' when he realized
That he hadn't been unloved or alone all his life
His arms were stretched out as far as they go
Nailed to the cross, for the whole world to know

[Chorus]
I love you this much and I'm waiting on you
To make up your mind, do you love me too?
How ever long it takes, I'm never giving up
No matter what, I love you this much

With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil

She takes 'til I break and I can’t get more

The Anthem,Good Charlotte,"

[Intro]
Yeah
Here we go

[Verse 1]
It's a new day but it all feels old
""It's a good life"" – that's what I'm told
But every day, it all just feels the same
At my high school it felt more to me
Like a jail cell, a penitentiary
My time spent there – it only made me see
That I don't ever wanna be like you
I don't wanna do the things you do
I'm never gonna to hear the words you say and...

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna– I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 2]
""Go to college or university
Get a real job"" – that's what they said to me
But I could never live the way they want
I'm going to get by and just do my time
Outta step while they all get in line
I'm just a minor threat so pay no mind
Do you really wanna be like them?
Do you really wanna be another trend?
Do you wanna be part of that crowd? 'Cause...

[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna– I don't ever wanna be you
Don't wanna be just like you
Uh, what I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
You, don't wanna be you

[Verse 3]
Shake it once, that's fine
Shake it twice, that's okay
Shake it three times
You're playing with your self again
(You, don't wanna be just like you)
What I'm saying is
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me
You, don't wanna be just like you
(Just like you)
This is the anthem, throw all your hands up
Now you can feel me, sing if you're with me

I'm Just A Kid,Simple Plan,"

[Verse 1]
I woke up, it was 7
I waited 'til 11
Just to figure out that no one would call
I think I've got a lot of friends, but I don't hear from them
What's another night all alone?
When you're spending everyday on your own
And here it goes

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me
Tonight

[Verse 2]
And maybe when the night is dead
I'll crawl into my bed
I'm staring at these four walls again
I'll try to think about the last time I had a good time
Everyone's got somewhere to go
And they're gonna leave me here on my own
And here it goes

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me

[Verse 3]
What the hell is wrong with me?
Don't fit in with anybody
How did this happen to me?
Wide awake I'm bored and I can't fall asleep
And every night is the worst night ever

[Bridge]
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
Yeah, I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid
And I'm just a kid
I'm just a kid, I'm just a kid

[Chorus]
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
I'm just a kid and life is a nightmare
I'm just a kid, I know that it's not fair
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Nobody wants to be alone in the world
Nobody cares, 'cause I'm alone and the world is
Having more fun than me tonight

I'm all alone tonight
Nobody cares tonight
'Cause I'm just a kid tonight

The Reason,Hoobastank,"

[Verse 1]
I'm not a perfect person
There's many things I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Verse 2]
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with every day
And all the pain I put you through
I wish that I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

That I just want you to know

I've found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

[Outro]
I’ve found a reason to show
A side of me you didn’t know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

Blessed is the one who trusts You
Like a tree that cannot be moved
You say jump to arms wide open
I am scared but I am willing
For blessed is the one
Blessed is the one who trusts in You

Shepherd of my heart
Lead me to where You are
And I remember all Your goodness
Suffering through the desert places
You never said it would be easy
You just promised You'd be with me
For blessed is the one
Blessed is the one who trusts in You
You, faithful, just, and good
Shepherd of my heart
Lead me to where You are
You, who holds my destiny
I'll follow foolishly
You love will by my song
So I will trust in You
I will trust You in the pain
When I can't see past today
When it's hard to lift my hands to praise You
I will trust You

"
For My Good,Trip Lee,"

[Intro: Trip Lee]
You ever felt like stuff just never goes your way?
Like everything's against you?
Well, God never promised He would keep me away from all those trials
If I want perfection I'm a have to wait till later
And I ain't trippin' cause He has promised
That He will work all things together for the good of those who love Him and are called accordin' to His purpose
Let's praise Him for that
Yeah

[Interlude: Trip Lee]
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
It's 'bout that time to let them know this how we feel about Him
Yeah, yes sir, let's go

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
I know this life may bring, pain and a broken heart
I've shared my share of tears, plus I got lonesome scars
I've had my ups and downs, my rises and my falls
So sometimes people ask me, how I survive it all
I tell 'em 'bout my Lord, let's get it understood
My King controls it all and He does it for my good
My Savior bought me, then gave me new life, this in His name
Now that He got me, I know that He'll bring me through the pain

[Hook: Jai]
For my good, You did it all for my good
You'll never put so much on me
When I couldn't take it, I know I can make it
Cause everything's gon' be ok
Say it's all good, it's all good
It's all good, God You are are so so good
Say it's all good, it's all good
It's all good, cause You know it's for my good

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Trip Lee]
He ain't gon' give me nothing, if it ain't good for me
Sometimes I ask for something, that seemin' good to me
But my God is wiser, it's clear He really loves me
Sometimes He tells me ""No! "", if not it will be ugly
How I'm gon' question Him? Deny my rest in Him?
He'll give us all things, He gave His son who bled for sin
My Lord is more than good, it's clear that He delights to give
Good gifts to His sons and daughters, all those who in Christ are hid

[Hook: Jai]

[Bridge: Jai]
Through all your problems, give it to Him
You just remember that He's bigger than them
There is a purpose, there is a plan
You'll be much better than you've ever been

[Hook: Jai]

God Is Enough (feat. Flame),Lecrae,"

[Verse 1: Flame]
(We so impressed)
With them ladies
Who be drivin' Mercedes
Who be drivin' them crazy
And we gotta be crazy
(We so impressed)
With them fellas
Who be makin' them jealous
Who be makin' them stellas
And we gotta be crazy
(I'm so impressed)
King who on the throne
Who left his heavenly home
Never did a thing wrong
They crucified him on
A tree, there he made
It was crazy how it set the stage
For his resurrection from the grave
That gets me amazed
(You can be) the flyest man
(With a) hundred grand in your hand
Swag right, sag tight
And a Gucci fan
(You can) be the richest, be the smartest, be the hardest, all of that
But I guarantee before I die they all are fallin' flat

[Hook: Jai]
Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV
Education, cars, and clothes
Fashion lights and jewelry
(Focused on the wrong stuff)
Now I got my eyes on you
And now I know that
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough-nough
Never too much-uch
More than enough-nough
God is enough-nough
You are enough for me

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Party like the fast life, hurry this the last flight
Chasin' all your dreams, this right here could be your last night
And man you finally got your cash right
But it never seems to last right
You know you sick of lookin', you sick of chasin'
I think you know the truth, you just don't wanna face it
Your life is empty, though you havin' fun
You never satisfied, you never get enough
You go from thrill-seekin' to pill-poppin'
From heavy drinkin' to club-hoppin'
You just can't stop it, like you're a slave
And you chasin' nothin' all the way into the grave

[Hook]
Used to want a lotta things
All the stuff that's on TV

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want
Takes away my fears, you restore my soul
Off into the sky, the dead in Christ arise
To be with you forever, see with the clearest eyes
Quench my inner thirst, there's something more in life
No money, cars, relationships compare to joy in Christ
Love that falls from selfish ones that like to flirt with self-destruct
No need to stut, know what I want, to keep it, but my God's enough

[Hook]
Used to want a lotta things

Jobs I Had Before I Got Rich & Famous,Walter Martin,"

[Verse 1]
Mowing lawns, saving up for a guitar
When I was fifteen and long and lean
And just like that grass, boy, I was green
Delivering roses in Washington D.C
Going off to college so I had to save up
But delivering roses really sucks
Sweating all summer in a slimy tux
But at least I made a couple bucks

[Verse 2]
Freshman in college I was delivering pizza
But to deliver one pie was a half an hour round trip
And college kids, man, they don’t tip
So I quit and it was their loss
‘Cause I was the only driver not stealing from the boss
And siphoning gas from students cars

[Verse 3]
Metropolitan Museum at the telephone switchboard
When a caller would ask for Phillip de Montebello
I’d transfer to my apartment where an unsuspecting fellow
My roommate Stewart, so sound asleep
Would answer the phone when he heard the beep
Pretty quick they’d realize that he wasn’t Phillip

[Verse 4]
Information counter at the Cloisters Museum
And one day Billy Joel walks in
I take a long, long look at him
A dignified old music man
And that’s when I devised my plan

[Verse 5]
And that little plan has brought me here
Where the spotlight shines and the people all cheer
And the pretty girls flock from far and near
To touch my hand and hear my song
And buy my t-shirts and sing along
Goddamn, this sure beats mowing lawns

"
On the Floor,Chastity Belt,"

I'm never satisfied
I keep feeding myself lies
And when I realize that we're all alive
I feel like I could die

But it's fine
But it's fine
But it's fine

We're on the floor
All my friends and me
But I still want more
Colors blurring

Can't remember a thing without confusing things
What did you say? What did you mean?
Ends in my dream, all my friends were there
Surrounding me, smiling

In my dream
In my dream
In my dream

We're on the floor
All my friends and me
But I still want more
Colors blurry

"
Yeah,Joe Nichols,"

It was just another night in the hayfield
'Til she climbed down off of them four wheels
Yeah, yeah

Soon as that sundress hit the headlights
Every tailgate way out there was like yeah, yeah

She started walking over to me
Like she already knew me
Sat down right beside me
And asked if I was here alone

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)
Yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

She brought me a cup and I tried it
A little fruity but she asked if I liked it
So I said yeah (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Then she played me some band on her iPod
Kinda hit me kinda hippie and I thought, ""Naw.""
But I said yeah, yeah, yeah

She said you wanna take a walk
To the river maybe cool off
She said, ""I know a good spot.""
And then she took my hand

And I said
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, how could I say no?
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

A little later under that full moon
I didn't want the night to end too soon
I said, ""It's getting late, do you need to go?""
And she said no

I was like
Yeah, yeah
Like I was nodding right along to a song on the radio
Yeah, yeah
Girl, if you say so
Whatever you're drinking, that's what I'm drinking
Girl, you're calling the shots tonight
Whatever you're thinking, that's what I'm thinking
Tell me what you got in mind

So I can say yeah, yeah (yeah, yeah)

Take Me To The King,Tamela Mann,"

[Chorus]
Take me to the King
I don't have much to bring
My heart is torn in pieces
It's my offering
Take me to the King

[Verse 1]
Truth is I'm tired
Options are few
I'm trying to pray
But where are you?
I'm all churched out
Hurt and abused
I can't fake
What's left to do?
Truth is I'm weak
No strength to fight
No tears to cry
Even if I tried
But still my soul
Refuses to die
One touch will change my life

[Chorus]
Take me to the King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn in pieces
It's my offering
Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And sing to You this song
Please take me to the King

[Verse 2]
Truth is it's time
To stop playing these games
We need a word
For the people's pain
So Lord speak right now
Let it fall like rain
Oh, yeah, We're desperate
We're chasing after you

[Bridge]
No rules, no religion
I've made my decision
To run to You
The healer that I need

[Chorus]
Take me to the King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn to pieces
It's my offering
Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And to sing to You this song
Take me to the...
Lord we're in the way
We keep making mistakes
Glory is not for us
It's all for You

[Chorus]
Take me to the King
I don't have much to bring
My heart's torn to pieces
It's my offering
Lay me at the throne
Leave me there alone
To gaze upon Your glory
And sing to You this song

Take me to the King
Take me to the King
Take me to the King

[Verse 1]
With her wine-stained lips, yeah, she’s nothing but trouble
Cold to the touch, but she’s warm as a devil
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
She takes 'til I break and I can’t get more

You got me in chains
You got me in chains for your love
But, I wouldn’t change
No, I wouldn’t change this love
You got me in chains

No, I wouldn’t change this love
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me
Trynna break the chains, but the chains only break me

Alone in the night ‘til she knocks on my door, oh no
Wasted again, but I can’t say no, whoa

Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Baby, tell me why, why you do, do me wrong?
Gave you my heart, but you took my soul

Take Your Time,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

Made In America,Toby Keith,"

[Verse 1]
My old man's that old man
Spent his life living off the land
Dirty hands and a clean soul
Breaks his heart seeing foreign cars
Filled with fuel that isn't ours
And wearing cotton we didn't grow

[Chorus]
He’s got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

[Verse 2]
His wife, she's that wife that decorates on the 4th of July
But says ""every day's Independence Day""
She’s golden rule, teaches school
Some folks say it isn't cool, but she says the Pledge of Allegiance anyway

[Chorus]
Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

[Bridge]
Born in the heartland, raised up a family
Of King James and Uncle Sam

[Chorus]
Got the red, white, blue flying high on the farm
Semper fi tattooed on his left arm
Spends a little more at the store for a tag in the back that says U-S-A
Won’t buy nothing that he can't fix with WD-40 and a Craftsman wrench
He ain't prejudiced, he's just made in America

He’s made in America

If I Could Do It Again,Corey Smith,"

[Verse 1]
Best friends in a pickup truck, we were Panama City bound
Eight hours in the back, wind blowin' with the sun beatin' down
Makin' plans to raise some hell, celebratin' our senior year
I had a trash bag full of clothes and a suitcase full of beer
We got pulled over by the Alabama State Patrol
But they never found the booze, so they had to let us go

[Chorus]
If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
Pass out on the beach drinkin' Golden Grain
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Then I'd go for a swim and start drinkin' again
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, yeah
Do it again

[Verse 2]
I met a girl from Tennessee, no I don't remember her name
But I can still see her top pulled down and that belly button ring
We kissed but I didn't tell, no, I had to keep it hush on the down low
I had girlfriend back at home and she didn't need to know
Sure I felt a little guilty as we dusted off our clothes
But she was wild and she was fine Lord, worth every lie I told
Aww yeah

[Chorus]
If I could do it again, you know I'd do it the same
With the one night stands and the drinkin' games
You know I'd check out the girls at the clubs, hookin' up whenever I could
Sex on a beach never tasted as good
I'd break my first love's heart, forget to hide the fingernail marks
If I could do it again

[Verse 3]
I'd get sunburned on a new tattoo, lose my favorite jeans and my tennis shoes
Get kicked out of my hotel room and sleep in the truck for a night or two
Blow all my money, have to call my dad and work two months just to pay him back
Take bong hits and laugh like hell, flip the police off and get hauled to jail
If I could do it again I'd do it the same, not one regret I wouldn't change a thing

[Chorus]
I'd check out the girls at the club, hookin' up whenever I could
I'd wake up covered in sand with that bottle in my hand
Aww yeah
I'd break all of the rules just liked I used to do
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord
If I could do it again, how 'bout you
I'd like to do it again, Lord

Best friends in a pickup truck, we were Panama City bound

"
Twenty-One,Corey Smith,"

When I was only seventeen, couldn't wait for twenty one
I'd hang around on Clayton Street in the bars there gettin' drunk
A baseball cap and a fake ID would get me in the clubs
Then I would dance with the college girls and lie about who I was
I'd say ""I'm pre-Med. here at UGA, live on Milledge Avenue
I was raised over in Buckhead, I drive a BMW.""

I was breakin' hearts and takin' names and numbers just for fun
Stealin' kisses wishin' I was twenty one

When Thursdays came and pocket change would quickly disappear
Upstairs at Lowry's Tavern, we'd pay a nickel for every beer
Shootin' pool, smokin' cigarettes with a dizzy head and a grin
Four A.M. on a school night, still hangin' out with my friends
One hour's sleep on a dirty couch, no shower, off to school
Smellin' just like a brewery with a bad hangover too

The teachers all would hassle me: ""Stay awake, pay attention""
I was catchin' hell, wishin' I was twenty one

The youngest one of all my friends, I didn't act my age
Too cool for the football games and the homecoming parades

Now I look back and I have to smile, cause boy it was fun
Bein' seventeen, wishin' I was twenty one

Now I'm only twenty six, feelin' more like fourty three
My hairline's disappearing, and I never get ID'd
My clothes are out of fashion, no I'm not cool anymore
In the bed by ten o'clock each night, and up at half-past four
Still I go down to that college town when the Bulldogs play at home
I drink keg beer from a trash can til the whole damn thing is gone

Then I look at all those college girls so innocent and young
And I just check 'em out, and say ""Damn... I wish I was twenty one""

My Ol' Bronco,Luke Bryan,"

[Verse 1]
Ain't no doors and no windows
Just a roll bar and a radio
If it rains you're gonna get wet
But that old 302 ain't let me down yet

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's a cutout picture of the 70's
When everything felt so free

[Chorus]
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
My ol' Bronco

[Verse 2]
I flipped it over up on Arnold Hill
Turned it back over and fixed the grill
You know where I been by that old oil spot
Most times it's in the beach bar parking lot

[Pre-Chorus 2]
No it ain't hard to pick me out
Cause it's the only one in this town

[Chorus]
It's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No, I ain't gonna ever let her go
My ol' Bronco

[Outro]
Yeah it's yellow and a little bit of rust
Looking good for 42 years young
Ten sets of tires, a hundred bonfires
And it can still light up a backroad
It was built for a day like this
A clear blue sky and a white sand kiss
It's three on the tree and geared down for going slow
No I ain't gonna ever let her go

When you're dancing with him, and you're looking at me

Or the one where you don't kiss me
Then you tell me that you miss me

The one where you act all surprised
Like you didn't know I'd be at the party

But you always leave something over at my place
So I gotta bring it back
Now baby why you gotta be like that

Spring Breakdown,Luke Bryan,"

[Verse 1]
It's been a real good run
Playin' out here in the sun
Year after year, beer after beer
I've watched this crowd grow
I swear you all don't know
What you mean to me
It's been something to see
I remember when we started
This week long party
And to think that it's over
It makes me want to spring break down

[Chorus]
Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

[Verse 2]
Next year I'll go through pictures
Wishin' I was down there with ya
Hanging out, it'll kill me then
But I'm here right now
So let's raise up our cups
Can't throw 'em up high enough
Let me buy you one last round
Before I spring break down

[Chorus]
Just think about all our good times together
Yea, how we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
But the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down

[Verse 3]
We made this sun tan city
And all of ya'll sang along so loud
We took this beach town over
You all do not know if might sound crazy
But you gonna make my spring break down

[Chorus]
Just think about all our good times together
And when we rocked this town
And I wish it could last forever, and ever
Ooo...but the sand runs out
And we roll back home
Just think about how
This is our last song
I'm about to spring break down
Swear I'm about to spring break down

[Outro]
Ya'll up there on them shoulders
Good and bad hangovers
I'm about to spring break down

Night One,Luke Bryan,"

[Verse 1]
Where you been hiding all week girl?
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar, in every place
Somehow I miss your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

[Chorus]
Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

[Verse 2]
Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Let's make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
'Fore we say our goodbyes girl

[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning you'll be gone, gone, gone
So baby let's just hold on

[Chorus]
Wish I had met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One
Girl we woulda had one hell of a time
If I had met you on night one

[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning we'll be gone, gone, gone
Yeah baby that's just wrong

[Chorus]
Wish I had met you on night one
What a week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up
Waking up, no we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have
Seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
Slow down, son
I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
Yeah yeah, I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one

Stay,Miley Cyrus,"

[Verse 1]
Well, it's good to hear your voice
I hope you're doing fine
And if you ever wonder, I'm lonely here tonight
I'm lost here in this moment and time keeps slipping by
And if I could have just one wish, I'd have you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

[Chorus]
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay

[Verse 2]
Well, I try to live without you
And tears fall from my eyes
I'm alone and I feel empty
God, I'm torn apart inside
I look up at the stars, hoping you're doing the same
And somehow I feel closer
And I can hear you say

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh, I miss you
Oh oh, I need you

[Chorus]
And I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder every day
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will

[Bridge]
Stay, always stay
I never wanna lose you
And if I had to, I would choose you
So stay
Please always stay
You're the one that I hold onto
'Cause my heart would stop without you

[Chorus]
I love you more than I did before
And if today I don't see your face
Nothing's changed, no one can take your place
It gets harder everyday
Say you love me more than you did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask me, I will stay
I will stay
I'll always stay
And I love you more than I did before
And I'm sorry that it's this way
But I'm coming home, I'll be coming home
And if you ask I will stay
I will stay
I will stay

Every Rose Has Its Thorn,Miley Cyrus,"

[Verse 1]
We both lie silently still in the dead of the night
Although we both lie close together, we feel miles apart inside
Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
Yeah, I tried
But I guess that's why they say...

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does

[Verse 2]
I listen to our favorite song playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I, I could let you know somehow

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn

[Bridge]
Though it's been a while now
I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains (Yeah)

[Interlude]
Every rose, every rose
Every rose has its thorn

[Verse 3]
I know I could've saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of making love, we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn (Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
(Every rose, every rose, every rose)
Every rose has its thorn
Yeah, it does

Monsters,Timeflies,"

[Chorus: Katie Sky]
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Verse 1: Timeflies]
A cup of coffee still steaming
Staring back at me and it’s blacker than the night now
I’m awake but still sleeping
I keep telling myself I’ll be alright (I won’t)
And I know it can’t get worse than today
Sitting here and she’s trying to rehearse what to say
See, she’s in the bathroom hoping I’m not in earshot
While she’s getting used to the sound of a teardrop (Splash)
It hits the tile
And I know it’s been a while since you seen me
Smile and laugh like I used to
I’ve been in denial since it happened
Just take me to the past
‘Cuz I just can’t imagine losing you (too)
I can’t explain this so I’ll keep it all inside
Wear my pain, but it’s masked by my pride
She came to hold me and she cried
Told me this as she stared into my eyes, said

[Chorus: Katie Sky]
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Verse 2: Timeflies]
I can’t, you won’t like what you see
If you were in my head and had to hear my plea
It’s like, I can’t believe this is happening to me
And could someone please shut this fucking answering machine
So I can start leaving these messages
That you will never get
And all these cries for help
You’ll never see and never check
But I guess it’s easy for you to leave me
But believe me
See this isn’t something that Imma just forget
I would trade it all for one more minute
Don’t you see I really need you to talk to
I’m still sitting here wondering who did it
While I’m staring out our front door
Knowing you’ll never walk through
Said you’d come right back
And now you’re gone like that
A blank stare as I stand so alone
And know you’re never coming home (damn)

[Chorus: Katie Sky]
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave
And chase them all away

[Verse 3: Timeflies]
I got a heart made of fool’s gold
Got me feeling so cold
You keep chipping away
All the promises that I told
Felt like I was on those
But keep slipping away
I want nobody else
But it’s hard to get to know me
When I don’t know myself
And it helps
Cause I felt
I was down, I was out
Then you looked at me now
And said

[Chorus 2: Katie Sky]
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave

[Chorus: Katie Sky]
I see your monsters
I see your pain
Tell me your problems
I’ll chase them away
I’ll be your lighthouse
I’ll make it okay
When I see your monsters
I’ll stand there so brave

I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm,Ella Fitzgerald,"

The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
I've got my love to keep me warm

Off with my overcoat, off with my glove
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

Yes, snow is snowing, the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

Yes, I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
Baby, I've got my love to keep me warm

Oh, off with my overcoat, off with my gloves
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

The snow is snowing, the wind is blowing
But I can weather the storm, storm, storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me warm

I can't remember a worse December
Just watch those icicles form
What do I care if icicles form
Thus I've got my love to keep me warm

Yes, off with my overcoat, off with my gloves
I need no overcoat, I'm burning with love
My heart's on fire, the flame grows higher
So I will weather the storm
What do I care how much it may storm
I've got my love to keep me, I've got my love to keep me
I've got my love to keep me warm

It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas,Johnny Mathis,"

[Verse 1]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow

[Verse 2]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

[Verse 3]
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben;
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen;
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again

[Verse 4]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go;
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

[Verse 5]
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas;
Soon the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas (Christmas)
Christmas (Christmas, Christmas)

In them Wolf Grey's like it's my house
Drinking out the bottle, I got no respect
Looking like a model, who just got a check

If you're a lame, that's a shame you can't hang with us
I'm MC Hammer fly, you can't touch
J's so fly I should work at Flight Club

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
Put on my J's and dance the whole night away

More kicks than the players, call me up I'm scorin'
Hit it like a free throw, tongue out like I'm Jordan

Gotta a joint if you wanna get stoned, got choppers if they wanna try me
Pro athlete I'm not no wannabe
Waitress asked how many bottles? I said 23

Honest, so hot, mind on a comet
Fast life sometimes feel like I'm in a comic
I don’t give a fuck bitch, with or without a condom
Fat Joe, pockets lean back like a recliner
I'm in this, representin' West Side
Lotta people try to tell me I'm the next guy
Bat Gang, got it tatted by my left eye
Chain gang over here, no neck tie
Bitch you know I'm all about the business
From beginning to the ending never simpin', never slippin
Sipping P-A-T-R-O-to the-N
And if I'm in the building know it's complaints from the tenants

At your door like The Shining, egh
Feel like can't nobody stop me, I'm a hot nigga

Donald Trump,Mac Miller,"

[Intro]
Hey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man is kinda high over here *Laughs*

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him ‘cause he started out here locally
Hopefully I'll be at the top soon
For now I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say fuck it
‘Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear them talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

[Verse 2]
Uh, uh, uh
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring a friend
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

[Refrain]
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?

[Chorus]
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gonna win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap

Look At Me Now,Chris Brown,"

[Intro: Chris Brown]
I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can't even get in!
Hahaha
Leggo

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said, ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say, ""On my dick""
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay
Okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka!

And all them other cats you run with, get done with, dumb quick

All over some dumb shit, ain't that some shit
Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club, cause everytime
You come around, it's like (what) I just gotta get my dick sucked
And I don't know who the fuck you think you talkin to
But I'm not him, aight slim? So watch what you do
Or you gon' find yourself, buried next to someone else
And we all thought you loved yourself
But that couldn't have been the issue, or maybe
They just sayin' that, now cause they miss you
Shit a nigga tried to diss you
That's why you layin' on your back, lookin' at the roof of the church

Off the chain I leave niggas soft in the brain
Cause niggas still want the fame, off the name
First of all, you ain't rapped long enough
To be fuckin' with me and you, you ain't strong enough
So whatever it is you puffin' on that got you think that you Superman
I got the Kryptonite, should I smack him with my dick and the mic?
Y'all niggas is characters, not even good actors
What's gon' be the outcome? Hmm, let's add up all the factors
You wack, you're twisted, your girl's a hoe
You're broke, the kid ain't yours, and e'rybody know
Your old man say you stupid, you be like, ""So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go""
I'm tired of weak ass niggas whinin' over puss
That don't belong to them, fuck is wrong with them?
They fuck it up for real niggas like my mans and them
Who get it on on the strength of the hands with them, man

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me lose my cool
Up in here, up in here

I bring down rains so heavy it curse the head
No more talkin - put him in the dirt instead
You keep walin - lest you tryin to end up red
Cause if I end up fed, y'all end up dead
Cause youse a soft type nigga
Fake up North type nigga
Puss like a soft white nigga
Dog is a dog, blood's thicker than water
We done been through the mud and we quicker to slaughter
The bigger the order, the more guns we brought out
We run up in there, e'rybody come out, don't nobody run out
Sun in to sun out, I'ma keep the gun out
Nigga runnin his mouth? I'ma blow his lung out
Listen, yo' ass is about to be missin
You know who gon' find you? (Who?) Some old man fishin
Grandma wishin your soul's at rest
But it's hard to digest with the size of the hole in your chest

Y'all gon' make me lose my mind
Up in HERE, up in here
Y'all gon' make me go all out
Up in here, up in here
Y'all gon' make me act a fool

'Cause I'm A Man,Tame Impala,"

[Produced by Kevin Parker]

[Verse 1]
Like the brutal morning sun
It dawns on me, what have I done?
Saying sorry ain't as good as saying why
But it buys me a little more time
Lost in the moment for the second time
Each fucking doubt I make, unleash a cry
I'm just pathetic, that's the reason why
In desperation, all that you can do is ask me why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Not often proud of what I choose
I'm a human, woman
A greater force I answer to

[Verse 2]
Once again, as it takes a hold
I am aware I'm not in control
You see, I have a conscience and it's never fooled
But it's prone to be overruled
You wanna know why I always think I’m right?
(Why?) You never accept defeat and let it slide
(Why?) I have no voice if I don’t speak my mind
(Why?) My weakness is the source of all my pride
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
Don't always think before I do
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
That's the only answer I've got for you (uh)
‘Cause I'm a man, woman
I'll never be as strong as you
I'm a human, human
A greater force I answer to (uh)

Saw the name of your band written on the marquee
It's a full moon tonight, so we getting rowdy
Yeah, we getting rowdy
Get-get-getting rowdy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Feeling like I'm a high schooler
Sipping on a warm wine cooler
Hot, 'cause the party don't stop
I'm in a crop top, like I'm working at Hooter's
We been keeping it PG
But I wanna get a little frisky
Come, give me some of that yum, like a lollipop

Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar
Steal some bubblegum from the corner mexi mart
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark
Causing trouble in the dark
Trou-trou-trouble in the dark

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Feeling like a sabertooth tiger
Sipping on a warm Budweiser
Touch me and gimme that rush
Better pack a toothbrush
Gonna pull an all nighter
We been keeping it kosher
But I wanna get it on fo' sure
Come, give me some of the yum, like a lollipop
Baby, don't be scared

Come on, 'cause I know what I like

What's gonna be after this
I wanna just live right now

Colors,Halsey,"

[Verse 1]
Your little brother never tells you but he loves you so
You said your mother only smiled on her TV show
You're only happy when your sorry head is filled with dope
I'll hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Verse 2]
You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
He said, ""You'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too""
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

[Pre-Chorus]
You're drippin' like a saturated sunrise
You're spilling like an overflowin' sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece
And now you're tearin' through the pages and the ink

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Bridge]
You were red, and you liked me because I was blue
But you touched me, and suddenly I was a lilac sky
Then you decided purple just wasn't for you

[Chorus]
Everything is blue
His pills, his hands, his jeans
And now I'm covered in the colors
Pull apart at the seams
And it's blue
And it's blue
Everything is gray
His hair, his smoke, his dreams
And now he's so devoid of color
He don't know what it means
And he's blue
And he's blue

[Outro]
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue
Everything is blue

Above The Clouds,Gang Starr,"

[Intro]
""It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose somewhere in outer space.""
""The mysteries of creation are there.""
""Up in the sky?"" ""Up in the sky.""
""The moon and the planets are there
And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there
And therefore as we set sail, we ask God's blessing
On the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked.""
""Prepared for lift off.""

[Verse 1: Guru]
I Self Lord and Master shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by Kings
Through the storms of days after
Unto the Earth from the Sun through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any firepower, for it's mindpower shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night off the lake
Word to the Father and Mother Earth
Seeking everlasting life through this Hell for what it's worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another Cee Cipher pulling my peeps to the curb
Heed the words, it's like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous pay a sacrifice to get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell, turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spray like street sweepers, little Daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature, narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
The seven and a half combined, over the front line
The ten percenters promoting slander in the airtime
Bear in mind jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades, heavenly praise and dues are paid

[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I leave scientists mentally scarred, triple extra large
Wild like rock stars who smash guitars
Poison bars from the gods bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge, shake 'em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone, ruin like ancient Rome
I span the universe and return to Earth to claim my throne
The maker, owner, plus soul controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky, the cloud's my sofa
Stand like Collossus regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life, so who to trust?
Who but us to supply ya with the fire
The burning truth, 150 Absolut proof
On the mic like Moses spoke in golden scribe
Survivor of the oldest tribe whose soldiers died
I notified families, we shed tears and mourn
But our hands are on the ammo 'cause the battle still on
Sound the horn, we come rumblin' through the function
Precise laser beam technique to touch somethin'
When we die hard, they'll build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world, we could have conquered it

[Hook: Guru]
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down
Above the crowds, above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual, above the clouds
Raining down, holding it down

We Looked Like Giants,Death Cab for Cutie,"

[Verse 1]
God bless the daylight, the sugary smell of springtime
Remembering when you were mine
In a still suburban town
When every Thursday I'd brave those mountain passes
And you'd skip your early classes
And we'd learn how our bodies worked

[Verse 2]
God damn the black night, with all its foul temptations
I've become what I always hated when I was with you then
We looked like giants in the back of my grey subcompact
Fumbling to make contact as the others slept inside

[Hook]
And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer than anyone would ever get

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the J.A.M.C.?
And reading aloud from magazines
I don't know about you, but I swear on my name
They could smell it on me
But I've never been too good with secrets
No...

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook]
And together there
In a shroud of frost the mountain air began to pass
Through every pane of weathered glass
And I held you closer

"
Bukowski,Modest Mouse,"

[Chorus]
Woke up this morning, and it seemed to me
That every night turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
God, who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?

[Verse 2]
Well we sat on the edge of the river
The crowd screamed, ""Sacrifice the liver!""
If God takes life, he's an Indian giver
So tell me now why, you'll tell me never
Who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

[Bridge 1]
Well see what you wanna see
You should see it all
Well take what you want from me
You deserve it all
Nine times out of ten
Our hearts just get dissolved
Well I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
But one time out of ten
Everything goes perfect for us all
Well I want a better place
Or just a better way to fall
Here we go

[Verse 3]
If God controls the land and disease
And keeps a watchful eye on me
If he's really so damn mighty
Well my problem is I can't see
Well who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?
Well who would wanna be
Who would wanna be such a control freak?

[Bridge 2]
Evil home stereo
What good songs do you know?
Evil me, oh yeah, I know
What good curves can you throw?

[Verse 4]
Well all that icing and all that cake
I can't make it to your wedding
But I'm sure I'll be at your wake
You were talk, talk, talk, talkin' in circles that day
When you get to the point
Make sure that I'm still awake, okay?

[Chorus]
I went to bed and didn't see
Why every day turns out to be
A little bit more like Bukowski
And yeah, I know he's a pretty good read
But God who'd wanna be
God, who'd wanna be such an asshole?
(I fucked up the last line)

"
Banquet,Bloc Party,"

[Verse 1]
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out
Why'd you feel so underrated?
Why'd you feel so negated?

[Chorus]
Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

[Verse 2]
She don't think straight
No, no, no, she don't think straight
She's got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

[Chorus]
Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into myself
I wanted to bite not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

[Bridge]
And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wait for you on the other side
And if you feel (And if you feel)
A little left behind (A little left behind)
We will wait for you on the other side

[Outro]
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire when you come
'Cause you know I'm on fire
'Cause you know I'm on fire so stomp me out
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
'Cause I'm on fire

"
Like A Friend,Pulp,"

[Verse 1]
Don't bother saying you're sorry
Why don't you come in?
Smoke all my cigarettes again
Every time I get no further
How long has it been?
Come on in now
Wipe your feet on my dreams

[Verse 2]
You take up my time
Like some cheap magazine
When I could have been learning something
Oh well, you know what I mean
I've done this before
And I will do it again
Come on and kill me, baby
While you smile like a friend
Oh, and I'll come running
Just to do it again

[Verse 3]
You are that last drink I never should have drunk
You are the body hidden in the trunk
You are the habit I can't seem to kick
You are my secrets on the front page every week
You are the car I never should have bought
You are the train I never should have caught
You are the cut that makes me hide my face
You are the party that makes me feel my age
And like a car crash I can see but I just can't avoid
Like a plane I've been told I never should board
Like a film that's so bad but I gotta stay till the end
Let me tell you now, it's lucky for you that we're friends

"
Changeling / Transmission,DJ Shadow,"

He cried, he cried, and he cried... rained 40 nights...
Played lots of chess ...made lots of friends...
...And he wept every time it would rain

This is not a dream, not a dream
We are using your brain's electrical system as a receiver
We are unable to transmit
Through your conscious neural interference
You are receiving this broadcast as a dream
We are transmitting from the year 1-9-.....

Pretentious Friends - feat. Busdriver,Modeselektor,"

[Intro]
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know

[Verse 1]
I run shit in this house, like I was now or never
And with no effort, I bet you I could change my name to Klaus
Or something mildly Flemish
Pick up a Saudi chemist from an Orange County dentist
Ouch
I’m whistling, trading, eating
At poetry readings at AA meetings
I text you pictures of my keister or cervix
Or dead bodies from a Middle Eastern skirmish

Damn, I’m oh so snooty
A bro gropes boobies, has sex with Snow White
At the jam, on pedal bikes
Replenishing electrolytes
You’re honored I dipped my junk in the fondue
Told boring stories, showed my blonde pubes
I’m from the church of Satan’s archdiocese
So I fart fire pits and heart giant tits

(Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know)

[Verse 2]
I’m a prick. All of our inane dialogue
And my day’s minutiae gets micro-blogged
Ew. Plus I smell like Fido the dog
In gray Pumas, I look like Sideshow Bob
Urinate in what the cod-fish swims in
Who was to think, I’m God’s gift to women?
Flirting with about 30 Asian chicks
With herniated discs, eating turkey bacon bits

[Skit]
Busdriver: ""Nigga.""
Pillow Talk: ""Oh hey boo, how you be?""
""Oh, oh. I saw you at the Cannes Film Festival.""
""No that wasn’t me. You didn’t see me down there, uh-uh baby.""
""Oh, yes.""
""You talking about Cannes? You a con.""
""Tell me about it.""
""I saw you getting jiggy at Sundance with no pants on.""
""In Holland?""
""Mhm.""
""Hmm, do tell. I bought those shoes also, for 30 Euros, at the Champs-Élysées.""
""Nigga, please. These shoes? This cummerbund? Oh step, hon. Oh and by the way, the paté?""
""The paté was fabulous.""
""Goose liver, nigga!""
""Yes.""

Get ‘em

[Verse 3]
Oh, I know, you want my R&B hook
Oh, I know, your brain's been partially cooked
When this breaks this pillow under the gourmet kibble
Your solar plexus be in this trouble hence the dribble, it's what the beat's for
There it is
My friendship's like a health plan
I think on a multi-tiered color telegram
The movie trailer leaked, I hope they get the plumber’s putty
My script writing takes three Welsh understudies

I enjoy the congress of the water buffalo
Hoes stop and hold 'em, rock salt through the double O’s
Y’all nigga, too, think I’m a hot date
With a Prop 8 slashed out on my ballot box
Salad tossed into a chocolate cake
Cause I’m so cute
My hoes they look at me and their water break
And babies pop out with one gold tooth

(Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know
Oh oh no, oh no, oh no, oh I know)

[Hook]
I never never repeat it over and over and over again
I’m one of your pretentious friends, pretentious friends, pretentious friends
I never never repeat it over and over and over again
I’m one of your pretentious friends, pretentious friends, pretentious friends

Survival,Eminem,"

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout
Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym
Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again
With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown
Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah, homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt, 'cause—

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut
What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself
With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust
It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what
Got me this far, picture me quittin'
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!
It's survival of what?

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

[Verse 3: Eminem]
(Yeah) So, get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it—it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do
As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem
Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!

[Chorus: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Berzerk,Eminem,"

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 1]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah

[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't that aftershave
Or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowin' up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowin' down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is, are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho…

[Pre-Chorus]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long

[Chorus 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M.
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls!

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down

Moment 4 Life,Nicki Minaj,"

I fly with the stars, in the skies
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire ('Pire)
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown, - yes!
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed, - yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ - me!
But I couldn't do it all alone - we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we're done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up!
It's a celebration, every time we link up
We done did everything, they can think of
Greatness, is what we on the brink of

Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you look tonight

Yes, you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheeks so soft
There is nothing for me, but to love you
And the way you look tonight

With each word, your tenderness grows
Tearing my fear apart
And that laugh wrinkles your nose
Touches my foolish heart

Lovely; never, ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight

And that laugh that wrinkles your nose
It touches my foolish heart

Lovely, Don't you ever change
Keep that breathless charm
Won't you please arrange it? Cause I love you

One, two, three, four, five
Everybody in the car, so come on let's ride
To the liquor store around the corner
The boys say they want some gin and juice, but I really don't wanna
Beer bust, like I had last week
I must stay deep, 'cause talk is cheap
I like Angela, Pamela, Sandra and Rita
And as I continue you know they're gettin' sweeter
So what can I do? I really beg you, my Lord
To me flirtin' is just like a sport
Anything fly, it's all good, let me dump it
Please set in the trumpet

A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita is all I need

A little bit of Jessica, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man

Jump up and down and move it all around
Shake your head to the sound
Put your hands on the ground
Take one step left and one step right
One to the front and one to the side
Clap your hands once and clap your hands twice
And if it looks like this then you're doin' it right

A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side

WTF Love Is,Tove Lo,"

[Verse 1]
I got fire eyes, glitter in my tear lines
And I’m coming down, ready for some new sounds
And I’m holding up all that I can think of
But where are you?
Where are you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, lonely babe
Stranded on the dance floor
Look for me
I know that I’m a handful
But you get me
Know what you signed up for
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams

[Chorus]
All the cards with all the love clichés
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love clichés
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?

[Verse 2]
I can feel the lights tingling from the sunrise
And I see the signs clinging to our last nights
Thinking you and I, we are of the same kind
So where are you?
Where are you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, lonely babe
Stranded on the dance floor
Look for me
I know that I’m a handful
But you get me
Know what you signed up for
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams

[Chorus]
All the cards with all the love clichés
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love clichés
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?

[Post-Chorus]
With a hand like this, I’m folding
All you need, yeah, I’ll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)
With a hand like this, I'm folding
Oh
All you need, yeah, I’ll be holding
(What the fuck do you think love is?)

[Bridge]
Where are you? (Oh)
Lonely babe
(Can’t focus)
Look for me

You get me
(What you wanted)
Live up to the best
Live up to the best and the worst of your dreams
Ah

All the cards with all the love clichés
I wouldn't have it any other way
Shake your head, you don't believe this
Then what the fuck do you think love is?
All the cards with all the love clichés

Shake your head, you don't believe this

It's All On U (T-Mass & LZRD Remix) [feat. Liam O'Donnell],Illenium,"

[Verse 1]
At first I didn’t think that I was cut enough to bleed
Then I saw my secrets getting swallowed by the sea
Through a telescope
I saw a diamond glow
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

[Chorus]
With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

[Bridge]
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

[Verse 2]
Can’t see, dark road, driving up the hills
Looking at the girl, hand barely on the wheel
Got no where to go
We can take it slow
How you brought me home
I guess I’ll never know

[Bridge]
I get my kicks from you
I get my kicks from you

[Chorus]
With God as my witness
Never had it so good
Jumping into love
Fire sets to dry wood
Started off as nothing
Now it’s gold
And it’s all on you

[Post-Chorus]
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you
And it’s all on you
And it's all on you

I get my kicks from you

Off My Mind,Aaron Taos,"

[Verse 1]
Well I don't know if you really mean it
Or if you're saying things before you think 'em through
So I'll go slow until you feel it
'Cause I'd rather play it safe then play it fool, oh, babe

[Chorus]
Over and over in my thoughts
I can't get enough
Over and over keep on trying
I gotta make you mine
Over and over in my thoughts
Don't ever stop
Over and over I keep on trying
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to resist telling the truth but I've been burned before
When I showed my heart and I played my cards too soon
Lesson learned, now I know the rules
But I can't shake this feeling and it's got me up on the ceiling for you

[Chorus]
Over and over in my thoughts
I can't get enough
Over and over keep on trying
I gotta make you mine
Over and over in my thoughts
Don't ever stop
Over and over I keep on trying
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

Down In The Valley,The Head and the Heart,"

I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade
Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days

Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways

Call it one drink too many
Call it pride of a man
But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand

Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin
Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin

We do it over and over and over again
We do it over and over and over again

And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
Down in the valley with
Whiskey rivers
These are the places you will find me hidin'
These are the places I will always go
These are the places I will always go

I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way back to where I started

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

One more for the stars and the eyes of the walls
I saw your face, I heard you callin' out

I saw your face in the crowd and you came out
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

There was a sign on the door and it reads to me
Just like the sun and the moon and the stars at night

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

Oh-oh, Oh-oh, Oh-oh-oh-oh, Oh-oh

I am on my way
I am on my way
I am on my way back to where I started

And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
Down in the valley with

These are the places you will find me hidin'
These are the places I will always go
These are the places I will always go

A year from now we'll all be gone
All our friends will move away

But I miss your face like hell

Sounds Like Hallelujah,The Head and the Heart,"

(One, two, one two three four)

I'm just waitin' on the sun
To close his eyes and call it a night
So we can put all our differences aside

I'm just waitin' on the moon
With all the stars and all its gloom
We can watch it fall right back in to place

So I won't keep myself around
Just to keep you warm

Singing like hallelujah for the first time

Medicine,Daughter,"

Pick it up, pick it all up
And start again
You've got a second chance, you could go home
Escape it all, it's just irrelevant

[Chorus]
It's just medicine
It's just medicine

[Verse 2]
You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when I met you
You've got a warm heart, you've got a beautiful brain
But it's disintegrating from all the medicine.

[Chorus]
From all the medicine
From all the medicine

You could still be what you want to
What you said you were when you met me
You could still be what you want to

Candles,Daughter,"

[Verse 1]
That boy, take me away, into the night
Out of the hum of the street lights and into a forest
I'll do whatever you say to me in the dark
Scared I'll be torn apart by a wolf in mask of a familiar name on a birthday card

[Chorus]
Blow out all the candles, blow out all the candles
""You're too old to be so shy,"" he says to me so I stay the night
Just a young heart confusing my mind, but we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene

[Verse 2]
Well I have brittle bones it seems
I bite my tongue and torch my dreams
Have a little voice to speak with
And a mind of thoughts and secrecy
Things cannot be reversed, we learn from the times we are cursed
Things cannot be reversed, learn from the ones we fear the worst
And learn from the ones we hate the most how to

[Chorus]
Blow out all the candles, blow out all the candles
""You're too old to be so shy,"" he says to me so I stay the night
Just a young heart confusing my mind, but we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed

[Bridge]
Cause we both know I'll never be your lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets
Well I'll never be a lover
I only bring the heat
Company under cover
Filling space in your sheets, in your sheets

[Chorus]
So, please just blow out all the candles, blow out all the candles
""You're too old to be so shy,"" he says to me so I stay the night
It's just a young heart confusing my mind, but we're both in silence
Wide-eyed, both in silence
Wide-eyed, like we're in a crime scene

Summertime,Girls,"

Out of my grave
Dust off my name
Get out a good pair of shoes
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Feeling the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Grow out my hair
Go anywhere
Sleep in until afternoon
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Feeling the breeze
Take it with ease
Shake off the big city blues
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Lay in the park
Smoke in the dark
Get high like I used to do
Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Summertime, soak up the sunshine with you

Suddenly I'm on the hook

If there's one thing I know
It's that I'm sticking with you

Take me to the countryside

If I manage to forget
Everything from as of yet
What a success

I feel like starting new
That's why I'm sticking with you
Nobody makes me feel better

Heart It Races - Dr. Dog Version,Dr. Dog,"

And we're slow to acknowledge the knots in our laces
Heart it races
And we go back to where we moved out, to the places
Heart it races

I bought it in a can, stirred it with my fingers, singing
Oom dada oom dadadada
Threw it out the window

Lately you been tan, suspicious for the winter, thinking
Oom dada oom dadada
Life's like little splinters
Life's like little splinters

And we're slow to acknowledge the knots in our laces
Heart it races
And we go back to where we moved out, to the places
Heart it races

I sold it to a man, and threw him out that window
He went, oom dada oom dadada
Made his wife a widow

Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone
Heart it races alone

New Summer,Young Galaxy,"

Hey
Here it comes again the beautiful warm weather
Right before the end of everything forever
The end of bars and clubs with lines around the block
The crowded dancefloors winding up to feel the drop
So meet me by the river, let's go for a ride
With the windows down and the stereo loud

(Chorus)
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moon
OooooOooooOooooOoooo
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moon
OooooOooooOooooOoooo
Hey, it's a new summer. Can we live there.. like it's our last one?
OooooOooooOooooOoooo

(Verse 2)
It never would have been as good if built to last
We never would have stood a chance if it didn't move fast
The end will come for holidays and sweet sixteen
For friends and getting lost in your computer screen
So meet me by the river, let's go for a ride
With the windows down and the stereo loud

(Chorus)
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moon
OooooOooooOooooOoooo
Feels like a dream tonight, a little break in time
As we howl at the moon

No Me Digas Que No,Xtreme,"

Maletas preparadas, digo que vas a hacer
Me dices que te marchas, que no piensas volver
Que ya tu ests cansada de mi estupidez
No entiendo tus razones, explcame por qu
Primero, por hipcrita y ms por infiel
Segundo, no supiste valorar mi querer
Tercero, yo por ti no siento ms amor
Y por eso me voy
Ay! no me digas que no que ya no me quieres
No me digas que no que ya no, jams
S que fall, pero no quiero que te vayas
No me digas que no que sin ti no soy nada
Ay! no me digas que no que ya no me quieres
No me digas que no que ya no, jams
S que fall, pero no quiero que te vayas
No me digas que no que sin ti no soy nada
Amor, amor, amor
Ahora se va de viaje y no lo puedo creer
Hoy se va la mujer la que me enseo a querer
Por todos mis errores y ahora no s que hacer
Estoy arrepentido y no la quiero perder
Primero, te repito que me fuiste infiel
Segundo, no supiste valorar mi querer
Tercero, yo por ti no siento ms amor
Y por eso me voy
Ay! no me digas que no, que no que ya no me quieres
No me digas que no que ya no, jams

No me digas que no que sin ti no soy nada

Through That Window (Enamorado Estoy),Xtreme,"

Como decirte que yo quiero hacerte mia
Y que tu no pienses mal de mi
Te abras dado cuenta de la forma que te miro
La paciencia casi ya perdi
I ain't gonna lie
The minute I Saw You Walking By
I Had To Have You One Way Or Another
Ponme atencin porque hay pocos como yo
Oye bien claro lo que voy a decir
Enamorado estoy
Contigo quiero amanecer
Y si no puedes enterder
Let me repear it in anorher language
I wanna make you mine
Let's see the sun come through that window
Hay poco tiempo que perder
De otra manera no puedo decirlo
Como decirte que cuando cierro los ojos
Siento tus labios Besandome
Es una fantasia me atormenta todo el dia
De tu fuente ya quiero beber
I ain't gonna lie
The minute I saw you walking by
I had to have You one way or another
Ponme atencin porque hay pocos como yo
Oye bien claro lo que voy a decir
Enamorado estoy
Contigo quiero amanecer

La Vida Es Un Carnaval,Celia Cruz,"

Todo aquel que piense que la vida es desigual
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que la vida es una hermosura, hay que vivirla
Todo aquel que piense que está solo y que está mal
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que en la vida no hay nadie solo, siempre hay alguien

Ay, no hay que llorar, que la vida es un carnaval
Es más bello vivir cantando
Oh, oh, oh, ay, no hay que llorar
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y las penas se van cantando

Todo aquel que piense que la vida siempre es cruel
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que tan solo hay momentos malos, y todo pasa
Todo aquel que piense que esto nunca va a cambiar
Tiene que saber que no es así
Que al mal tiempo buena cara, y todo pasa

Ay, no ha que llorar, que la vida es un carnaval
Es más bello vivir cantando
Oh, oh, oh, Ay, no hay que llorar
Que la vida es un carnaval
Y las penas se van cantando
Para aquellos que se quejan tanto
Para aquellos que solo critican
Para aquellos que usan las armas
Para aquellos que nos contaminan
Para aquellos que hacen la guerra
Para aquellos que viven pecando
Para aquellos nos maltratan
Para aquellos que nos contagian

Wild Things - Remix,Alessia Cara,"

Find table spaces, say your social graces
Bow your head, they're pious here
But you and I, we’re pioneers, we make our own rules
Our own room, no bias here
Let 'em sell what they are sellin', there are no buyers here
So gather all the rebels now, we’ll rebel-rouse and sing aloud
We don't care what they say no way, no way
And we will leave the empty chairs to those who say we can't sit there
We're fine all by ourselves

So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we’ll be alright, don’t mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don’t mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are

I lose my balance on these eggshells
You tell me to tread, I'd rather be a wild one instead
Don't wanna hang around the in-crowd
The cool kids aren't cool to me
They’re not cooler than we are

So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)

We will carve our place into time and space
We will find our way, or we'll make a way (say hey, hey, hey)
Find you're great, don't you hide your face
Let it shine, shine, shine, shine, shine, shine

So hey, we brought our drum and this is how we dance
No mistakin', we make our breaks, if you don't like our 808s
Then leave us alone, 'cause we don't need your policies
We have no apologies for being

Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be alright, don't mind us)
Find me where the wild things are (oh my, we'll be just fine, don't mind us, yeah)
Find me where the wild things are

Issues,Julia Michaels,"

[Verse 1]
I'm jealous, I'm overzealous
When I'm down, I get real down
When I'm high, I don't come down
I get angry, baby, believe me
I could love you just like that
And I could leave you just as fast

[Pre-Chorus]
But you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em

Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Verse 2]
You do shit on purpose
You get mad and you break things
Feel bad, try to fix things
But you're perfect
Poorly wired circuit
And got hands like an ocean
Push you out, pull you back in

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you don't judge me
'Cause if you did, baby, I would judge you too
No, you don't judge me
'Cause you see it from the same point of view

[Chorus]
'Cause I got issues
But you got 'em too
So give 'em all to me
And I'll give mine to you
Bask in the glory
Of all our problems
'Cause we got the kind of love
It takes to solve 'em

Yeah, I got issues
And one of them is how bad I need you

[Bridge]
(I got issues, you got 'em too)
And one of them is how bad I need you

Cold (feat. Future),Maroon 5,"

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Are we taking time or a time out?
I can't take the in-between
Asking me for space here in my house
You know how to fuck with me
Acting like we're not together
After everything that we've been through
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant, when we're kissing
Feel so different
Baby, tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for?
If you wanna leave, just leave
Why you wanna bite your tongue for?
The silence is killing me
Acting like we're not together
If you don't want this, then what's the use?
Sleeping up under the covers
How am I so far away from you?

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Distant (Oh), when we're kissing (Yeah)
Feel so different (Yeah)
Baby tell me how did you get so

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
Whoa, yeah
Whoa, yeah
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Verse 3: Future & Adam Levine]
Never thought that you were like this
I took the tag off, and made you priceless
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier
Now you tryna cut me off like a light switch, yeah
Tryna stay in our league
Saying that you need some time to breathe
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four-letter word
But the four-letter word don't sleep
We goin' two separate ways
You ain't been actin' the same
You gotta go, girl, where your heart used to be
You gold-dig every day
I switched the four-door to the two-door
'Cause I can't let my driver hear what you say
Girl, I tried to give you space
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Cold enough to chill my bones
It feels like I don't know you anymore
I don't understand why you're so cold to me
With every breath you breathe
I see there's something going on
I don't understand why you're so cold

[Post-Chorus: Adam Levine & Future]
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
Whoa, yeah
So tough, it’s a cold world
I don't understand why you're so cold

Oh, I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
And you tell me that you're pleased
And that I'm never alone

[Chorus]
You're a Good, Good Father
It's who you are, It's who you are, It's who you are
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am

Oh, I've seen many searching for answers far and wide
But I know we're all searching
For answers only you provide
Cause you know just what we need
Before we say a word

You're a Good, Good Father
It's who you are, It's who you are, It's who you are
And I'm loved by you
It's who I am, It's who I am, It's who I am

You are perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us, aah
You are perfect in all of your ways
Oh, you're perfect in all of your ways
You are perfect in all of your ways to us

[Verse 3]
Oh, it's love so undeniable
I, I can hardly speak
Peace so unexplainable
I, I can hardly think
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
As you call me deeper still
Into love, love, love

Papercut,Zedd,"

[Click here to read Zedd’s story about “Papercut”]

[Verse 1]
Now we're staring at the ceiling, you're so pretty when you're mad
All that I can hear is breathing, oh, oh
And we're stuck inside the silence, in a cold, cold war
We're too proud to say we're sorry, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

[Verse 2]
I find refuge in the distance, even when we're breaking down
Can we pause it just for one kiss? Oh, oh
Cause I never meant to hurt you, and I know you feel the same
Still the only one I run to, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like we're bleeding
So deep that we might not get back up
Our words, they tear through the surface
Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut

Right now it feels like we're bleeding

Like a paper, like a paper cut
Right now, don't know why I love you
But by the morning, when we wake up
I'll reach for you and remember
It was just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut
Just a paper, just a paper cut

Feels Like Home - Radio Edit,The Him,"

Time to pack my bags and leave, finally I feel the air I breathe in
And I can see the light, become a light in me
Well in your lights I'll always be

[Chorus]
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
And I move myself away, when it don't feel like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
Like home, it feels like home
Feel like home

It's time to be a man and leave, I'll leave your safe grounds
Stop some distance, I am a light so
Light my high, well I'll become a higher me

Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home
And I move myself away, when it don't feel like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home

Like home, but it feels like home
Feel like home

[Outro]
But it feels like home
Well now I love myself again, and it feels like home
Oh I don't know where I am, but it feels like home

Major keys, I'm the boss
Don't Griselda go off?
Left from the loft and went to Bergdorf
Most of these dudes is really quite soft
45 special, this is my cloth
'Bout to drop a album, this is my fourth
I don't put sugar in my spaghetti sauce
Drop a freestyle and get these hoes parched
Fire burn the obea man church
Pretty girls, when my girls get right
'Cause it's another day, let ya light shine bright
Ain't none of them in your lane
True mi have di game pon lock, dem wah code
Just link wit some hot gyal out ah road
True mi have di waist small, pretty, bus whine
Rolex nah deh pon uno dutty gyal time?
Yo, I told 'em pull up on me faster than Danica
That's on the low I'm tryna blow him like harmonicas
He call me queen, he know ""Nicki"" is the moniker
He want a mix between Hillary and Monica
I switch it up, I switch it up
Rip the beat, then I, I stitch it up
Travel, then I bounce, I ball-Sinead, Sir

Next Year - RAC Remix,Two Door Cinema Club,"

I don't know where I
Am going to rest my head tonight
So I won't promise that I'll speak
To you today

But if I ever find
Another place, a better time
For that moment
I was never what I am

Take to me to where you are
What you've become
And what you will do
When I am gone
I won't forget
I won't forget

Maybe someday you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me
Saying, ""I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year.""

In between the lines
Is the only place you'll find
What you're missing
That you didn't know was there

So when I say goodbye
You must do your best to try
And forgive me this weakness
This weakness

'Cause I don't know what to say
Another day
Another excuse to be sent your way
Another day, another year

Maybe someday you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me
Saying, ""I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year.""

And maybe sometime in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there
I said, ""I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year.""

If you think of me
I will think of you

Maybe someday you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me
Saying, ""I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year.""

Maybe sometime in a long time
You'll remember what I had said there
I said, ""I'll be home for next year.""

Maybe someday you'll be somewhere
Talking to me as if you knew me
Saying, ""I'll be home for next year, darling
I'll be home for next year.""

Game Plan,Ojivolta,"

[Verse 1: Jon Bellion]
Tried to fill your spaces, tried to round your bases
But we're in your basement getting high, getting high
Tried to be your certain, tried to be your firm grip
But you're more concerned with getting high, getting high

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I know you say that you love me, but your heart is a ghost
You're an angel, yeah, we already know
I know you think that you got me in your pocket, but no
Fuck your game plan and your X's and O's

[Post-Chorus: Jon Bellion]
O
X's and O's
O
Fuck your game plan and your X's and O's

[Verse 2: Jon Bellion]
Tried to be your stardust, tried to see your heart
But you are in your car just getting high, getting high
Tried to change your tempo, tried to feel your echo
But you'd rather let go, getting high, getting high

[Chorus: Jon Bellion]
I know you say that you love me, but your heart is a ghost
You're an angel, yeah, we already know
I know you think that you got me in your pocket, but no

ARTPOP,Lady Gaga,"

[Verse 1]
Come to me
In all your glamour and cruelty
Just do that thing that you do
And I'll undress you
Keep it tight
Sometimes the simplest move is right
The melody that you choose can rescue you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Verse 2]
Come to me
With all your subtext and fantasy
Just do that thing that you do
In a perverse hue
Lovers' kites are flown on beaches for public sight
The color palette you choose could profit you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
A hybrid can withstand these things
My heart can beat with bricks and strings
My ARTPOP could mean anything
Could try to sell you out
Or I could show you all the reasons why
My ARTPOP could mean anything

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

[Bridge]
Brushes with darkness won't help you create
Your destiny of self, but ARTPOP could mean anything, anything
I try to sell myself, but I am really laughing
Because I just love the music, not the bling
The music, not the bling

[Chorus]
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP)
We could, we could belong together (ARTPOP, ARTPOP, ARTPOP)

You make my, heart stop

Deer Dance,System Of A Down,"

[Verse 1]
Circumventing circuses lamenting in protest
To visible police, presence-sponsored fear
Battalions of riot police with rubber bullet kisses
Baton courtesy, service with a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

[Chorus]
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

[Verse 2]
A rush of words, pleading to disperse
Upon your naked walls, alive
A political call, the fall guy accord
We can't afford to be neutral on a moving train

[Pre-Chorus]
Beyond the Staples Center you can see America
With its tired poor avenging disgrace
Peaceful, loving youth against the brutality
Of plastic existence

[Chorus]
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

[Bridge]
Push them around
A deer dance, invitation to peace
War staring you in the face
Dressed in black
With a helmet, fierce
Trained and appropriate for the malcontents
For the disproportioned malcontents
A little boy smiled, it'll all be well
And say a little boy smiled, it'll all be well
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

[Chorus]
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around
Pushing little children
With their fully-automatics
They like to push the weak around

[Outro]
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
Push the weak around
They like to push the weak around

Coffee,Sylvan Esso,"

[Produced by Sylvan Esso]

True, it's dance, we know the moves
The bow, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news

Wrap me in your arms
I can’t feel it but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing

Wild winters, warm coffee
Mom’s gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it but

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the general attention
And stop, see the mix won't work
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same but the pair of feet change

My baby does the hanky-panky, baby
My baby does
(Rock me)
My baby does the hanky-panky, baby
(In your arms)
My baby does

Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the general attention
And stop, see the mix won't work
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment’s the same but the pair of feet change

Would it be cool, would you mind if I called you my boo?
What if the next whip you was pushing was the one I bought for you?
Can I be the one that meets your pops and take your mama shopping?

Wait, have you thought about it
Wait, really thought about it?
Maybe you should take some time
Call your girls and talk about it, yeah

[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it (Have it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Okay
Okay
Is that right?
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka!

5 O'Clock,T-Pain,"

[Hook: Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 1: T Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it cause you've been waiting on me
Since I said that I was hitting in the club
Sun be coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me textses
Like, ""Boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked with one of my chains on
She might come and find me (aw, aw, aw)
And then ask me kindly (aw, aw, aw)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And yet we wake up singing the same song

[Hook: Lily Allen & T-Pain]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)
Conversation got boring (Talk to me, girl)
You said you'd go into bed soon (Let's go)
So I snuck off to your bedroom (Come on)
And I thought I'd just wait there (Wait on me)
Until I heard you come up the stairs
(I won't let you stay lonely)
And I pretended I was sleeping (All right)
And I was hoping you would creep in (All right)
It's 5 o' clock in the morning

And I was hoping you would creep in

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
""What is he doing? What is he doing?""
Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
And you texting me like, ""I'mma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And do you know what time it is?""
(It's 5 o'clock in the morning) Ooh, and my bad, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin and I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing (worry 'bout nothing)
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me (no, no, no)
And then ask me kindly (no, no, no)
Do I want her to go crazy? We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Oh-oh, and you ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club
For me to leave here with one of them, that's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
IPhone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah, so by the time I'm at your crib
(It’s 5′O Clock in the morning) And you yawning
But I’ve been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom, floor to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause I’m sure you’re the best
You’re the one, so I let you, thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like “damn, babe you woke me up”
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun ain't the only thing thats coming up

[Hook: Lily Allen & (T Pain)]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning (Yeah)

No Love,Eminem,"

[Intro: Haddaway, Eminem, & Lil Wayne]
Love, love
Love, love, love
[Mumbling chorus]
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me no more
Young Money, yeah
No more
Love

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne & Haddaway]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's ""Fuck the world,"" get a child out her
Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers (no love)
I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour
Married to the game, but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
Uh, I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg
Money outweighin' problems on a triple beam
I'm stickin' to the script, you niggas skippin' scenes
Uh, be good or be good at it
Fuckin' right, I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in they mouth, so I guess it's fuck what they say
I'm high as a bitch, up, up and away
Man, I'll come down in a couple of days
Okay, you want me up in the cage?
Then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy, motherfucker, Blood gang, and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough, but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (yeah)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
That's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (haha!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around (yeah)
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)
Get 'em!

[Verse 2: Eminem, Lil Wayne, & Both]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been
In my whole entire life, I can (yeah)
See these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
Uh, I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again, they say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit and I stick it in
I ain't never giving in again (yeah)
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em? (yeah!)
They call me a freak, 'cause I like to
Spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em (haha)
Man, get these whack cocksuckers off stage!
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him? (oh!)
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch, I'ma let you finish in a minute
Yeah, that rap was tight, but I'm (yeah!)
'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um (yeah!)
Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd (yeah)
You can see the sparks from hot metal (yeah)
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted
The game, my soul started to rot, fellow (yeah)
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow
'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop
I'm standin' on my Monopoly board (uh)
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore (shit)
When you're so good that you can't say it
‘Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore (shit)
People just get sick ‘cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore (ow!)
And you can never break my stride (nope)
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride
Killin' the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is gettin' no mercy, mark my words
Ain't lettin' up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck, keep givin' them hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

[Chorus: Eminem, Lil Wayne, Both, & (Haddaway)]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now (uh)
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just don't (hurt me)
Yeah, that's right, it don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you (no more)
Ha, bitch, you get no (love)
You showed me nothing but hate (yeah!)
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
And I don't need you (don't hurt me)
That's right, you don't (hurt me)
And I don't need you (no more)
Don't wanna see you
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love) No! (No love)
Ha, bitch, you get (no love)
No! (No love) No! (No love)
And I don't need you (no more)

Yeah
Uh-huh
Um, uh-huh
Okay

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hello mothafucka, hey, hi, how ya durrn'?
It's Weezy F Baby, come to take a shit and urine
On these toilet bowl bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stomping on this beat like a motherfucking Sigma
Bad to the bristle, hat to the rizzle
I'm so official, all I need is a whistle
Bitch named Crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blow her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me, you probably never will
Riders rollin' with me, like 11 wheels
Find out where you livin', kill you in the kitchen
The feds tryin' to clip us, but we ain't even trippin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 2: Drake]
First off, you know what it is if you heard Drake
Making hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out 'cause I live in my workplace
I'll give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doing me and you could never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big-dicked bandit
Money flowin' like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin' purple clouds, nigga I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin' anybody slices out of my pie
Out of this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still, I keep it moving like a drive-by
I just tell the truth and so I'm cool in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin' hook shots
Cover me, I'm goin' in, and buckin' when the hook drop

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
It goes, hold up, wait one motherfuckin' minute
It's the El Capitan, I got motherfuckin' lieutenants
And if I said ""I'm goin' in"" then I motherfuckin' meant it
And if I brought it in the club then I'ma motherfuckin' spend it
Cost a few hundred bands and I'm motherfuckin' in it
No need for a room, yeah you know I'm fuckin' in it
She actin' like she not, but she know she fuckin' winnin'
She said ""I seen it all"", I say ""No you fuckin' didn't""
You ever bust ten nuts in a two-seater?
She said ""I can't feel my legs"", I'm like ""Bitch, me neither""
I'm goin' in, where should I begin?
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'ma be a legend even when my life end
And I'ma be a legend even when this night ends
Yeah I do my thang, hop up out it like BEM!
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin' like them

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
Bitch I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard
And I'ma go hard, and I'ma go hard

Weil du es nie an dich rankommen lassen wirst

Also glaub daran und du kannst niemals aufgeben
Du kannst deine ziele erreichen
Geh tief in dich und sage
Ich bin sicher ich kann

Ich bin sicher ich tanze
Ich bin sicher unsere welt ist gesund und das ist an was ich glaube
Deine Zweifel sind nur ein Teil in deiner seele ah ah
Aber du weit das deine moves es ihnen zeigen werden
Du fngst an Bilder in deinem Kopf zu kreieren
Und nun glaube dran, das sie irgendwann wahr werden
Es wird wieder gut, lass all deine ksse und den Stress zurck
Lass dich gehen, lass die musik flieen in dir
Geh raus aus dem Schmerz und fang an zu glauben

Jesus Saves,Daryl Coley,"

When your life is tossed and scorned
And the hope you have is gone
Don't give up on Jesus

When you've tried everything you know
And you're looking for a place to go
Don't give up on Jesus

When you've gone past your limit
And you can't take it another minute
Don't give up on Jesus

When this world spins round and round
And you can't tell your up from down
Don't give up on Jesus

For He's met all your needs before
And you dare not doubt He'll bring you out
And He'll do it over again
Just one wink of His eye
Put the shadows in the sky
For all to see agin

He sits high and He looks low
He knows the way that I should go
And the Lord He has promised
To supply all your needs
His throne's in heaven
And His foot's on earth
And He controls my destiny
And He knows the way we should go

Don't give up, no
Don't you dare give up
Don't you lose faith
You just try...

Pirate Flag,Kenny Chesney,"

[Verse 1]
Well I come from a little bitty, homegrown small town
Smoky Mountains, nice place to hang around
Moonshine, that's where they make it
Put it in a jug, makes you want to get naked
But I jumped on a greyhound bus one night
And took it all the way to the end of the line
Stepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand
What a long strange trip

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Verse 2]
Well my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind
Take a sip of rum and you really would know why
Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table
Blender in the kitchen, willing and able
Don't know what makes you say what the hell
But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail
Something about it makes her just want to dance
And she loves to dance

[Chorus]
I spent my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl

[Bridge]
Well I remember back home beneath the big old moon
Tucked back in the woods, yeah life was good
But here we are in a local bar and drinking shooting stars

[Outro]
I might spend my whole life running around
Still let the wind kind of blow me around
Well I dropped a note in a bottle
To a long-legged model
And I traded it in for a whole another world
A pirate flag and an island girl
A pirate flag and an island girl

"
When I See This Bar,Kenny Chesney,"

[Verse 1]
Well I see the souls of so many friends
And I see us all back here again
With sandy floors and ceiling fans
A Rastafarian one-man band with songs
That fills my memories like a tip jar
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Verse 2]
I see tourists at Christmas time
And I taste beers with a hint of lime
I feel lonely because it's not the same
Different faces and different names
Living like pirates out among the stars
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

[Verse 3]
And I see a kid coming into his own
And a man learning to move on
Somehow trying to find his way
A dreamer betting on blind faith
Chasing that sun and following his heart
Yeah, that's what I see
When I see this bar

[Chorus]
Pieces of our past slowly slip away
But time just stands still when I walk in this place

[Verse 4]
A few have moved on back to Maine
Jacksonville and Key Biscayne
Some are still living the dream
Stuck in still life it seems
No matter where they've been
Or where they are
Yeah, I see them here
When I see this bar
When I see this bar

[Verse 5]
I wonder where we go from here
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
Life isn't over but it's always near
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
I think about all the good times that we had
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
It makes me happy and it makes me sad
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
How could we be so close, now so far apart
(That's what I see when I see this bar)
That's what I feel, that's what I see
Yeah we were living like pirates and want to be stars
That's what I see when I see this bar

[Chorus]
That's what I see when I see this bar

Runnin' (Dying To Live),2Pac,"

[Intro: Rob May & 2Pac]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the
Nigga kingdom and shit, basically, know what I'm saying?
I was like, this is like a fucking election
It is that
You know what I am saying
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like…

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Runnin' from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police

[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

[Outro: 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that

My Time,Fabolous,"

[Hook - Jeremih]
Go hard today
Can't worry about the past cause that yesterday
I'mma put it on the line cause it's my time
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Guess what time it is? My, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's iTime
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock
Yeah, me o'clock, every time I check
Niggas don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex
Game's so bickery, so full of trickery
Nursery-rhyming: hickory, dickory
Blowing that sour, the hood call it ""pickery""
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, victory

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
My time's more like fly time
Don't call it ""getting dressed"", call it in the ""sky time""
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I took the time out, then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like a favor, I feel like a savior
They clocking my neck: I feel like I'm Flavor
I go so hard, Loso God, damn
Street fi-di-di-di-damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jeremih]
0-9, all mines
It's been a few years, now it's me, about time
You know I got committed with it since I've been up in the zone
Sign the dotted line, now it's on
So y'all better check your wrist-piece
Cause it's time to make history
Just hop in here up on this hit streak
How the, how the, how the hell you gonna evict me?
You know I'm here to stay, never clocking out
Big bottles we popping now, no telling where we stopping now
And I represent the Chic-a-g-o
On the track with F-A-B-O

Fight Music,D12,"

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

[Verse 1: Kon Artis]
I come to every club with intention to do harm
With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
Hidin' under tables as soon as I hear alarms
Paranoid thief that'll steal from his own mom
Kunivin' Kon Artis with a bomb
Strapped to my stomach, screamin', ""Let's get it on!""
A lush that love to drink, drunk-drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint
It's drastic, I'm past my limit of coke
I think I'll up my high by slittin' your throat
Push your baby carriage into the street 'til it's mince meat
Your mens been beat the minute I step onto your street
This is fight music

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
You know why my hands are so numb? (No?)
'Cause my grandmother sucked my dick and I didn't cum
(Oh) Smacked this whore for talkin' crap
So what if she's handicapped?
The bitch said Bizarre couldn't rap
I fuckin' hate you, I'll take your drawers down and rape you
While Dr. Dre videotapes you (Hell yeah!)
Satan done got me on this song, eatin' a hot dog
Readin' the Holy Qur'an while I'm on the john
Tired of wearin' this yellow thong
Take it back, Sisqo, you know where it belongs
Now, here's a gun, I'll put it in your palm
Now go over there and blow up Dru Hill's arms
Fuck the love songs!

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid

[Verse 3: Proof]
Just bring who you gon' bring on
Who you gon' swing on
I'm King Kong, guns blow you to kingdom-come
Show you machine gun funk
Sixteen M16's, one pump
The snub in my paw, shove it in your jaws
Have you runnin' out this fuckin' club in your drawers
We lovin' the brawls; there's nothin' to applaud
But fuck it, it's all good
The hood is up in us all; it's fight music

[Verse 4: Swifty McVay]
I'm a nigga that loves scuffles
And won't hesitate to sock you again with swollen knuckles
I'm like that, catch a nigga like bear traps
Blow his head back
Right in front of the precinct (You hear that?)
I slap your freak, bump you and won't speak
If you step on my feet, you get drowned in your own drink
I suffocated my shrink just for talkin'
Came back and fucked up his pallbearers
And made them drop his coffin; it's fight music

[Verse 5: Kuniva]
These beads I'm swingin' is stingin' them
See all these niggas?
When I step in the club I'm bringin' them
If any nigga lookin' too hard, we Rodney King'n them
Malice Greening them
And gasolinin' them with premium
Light a cigarette, flick it at 'em, or spit it at 'em
Hold up a picture of his family and kick it at him
Blast while you right-hookin', right when your wife's lookin'
Fuck fight music, bitch, this is losing-your-life music

[Verse 6: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called—

[Chorus: Eminem]
This kind of music, use it, and you get amped to do shit
Whenever you hear some shit and you can't refuse it
It's just some shit for these kids to trash they rooms with
Just refuse whenever they asked to do shit
The type of shit that you don't have to ask who produced it
You just know that's the new shit
The type of shit that causes mass-confusion
And drastic movement of people actin' stupid
It's fight music

Kings Never Die,Eminem,"

[Produced by The New Royales]

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can hear the drummer drummin'
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone
I know something's comin'
But I'm runnin' from it, to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was?
Was it too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens?
‘Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
‘Cause here I sit in Lucifer’s den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin, even if it means I'm sellin' my soul
Just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
‘Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head
Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?
How 'bout that? I’m somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark
This sport is somethin' I never bow-out at
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt
Even when you bitches are countin' me out
And I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about
Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
‘Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here
But I'm not a quitter; gotta get up, give it all I got or give up
Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong
But it feels like I slept on my neck wrong
‘Cause you're moving onto the next, but is your respect gone?
‘Cause someone told me that…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Don't give me that sob story, liar, don't preach to the choir
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep
Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way
I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features
And try to show out on a track with me
But it'd actually have to be
A fuckin' blow-out to get me to retire
Tell these new artists that kings never die
I know shit has changed in this age, fuck a Twitter page
Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform
But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback, as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the renegade
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage, and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em
‘Cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say!
It just goes to show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under attack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent-up rage, ‘cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door
Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?
‘Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow, and I'm not gonna be…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Verse 3: Eminem]
I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck
You’re gonna get Riddick Bowe’d
Critics'll end up in critical
Think your shit is dope, all you're gonna get is smoked
And I ain't stopping 'til I'm on top again
All alone and on a throne, like a token of respect
Or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm
And launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go
I'm still not leaving, stop for no one, I don't know
But I've been told, an obstacle that blocks your road, ya
Knock it over, time to go for the pot of gold, ‘cause…

[Bridge: Eminem]
They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky!
Try to hold on and prolong these moments
‘Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

[Verse 4: Eminem]
So you're tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral, berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus, I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness; kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
At Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas
Still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen
But Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat, ‘cause makin' the beat
Ain’t the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that sound-bombing, Thirstin Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God, just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't…

[Chorus: Gwen Stefani]
Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

[Outro: Gwen Stefani]
Kings never die

But now I know I'll make the rewards

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta let this fire keep burning
‘Cause I can’t seem to let this show
Instead of running I keep it slow
‘Cause I won’t let this take control

[Chorus]
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on
Got to get it, got got to get it
Got to get it, got got to get it on

[Bridge]
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I know you think you’re hurting but can you love?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
(I can feel it working, but can you?)
I can feel it working from the last you know
I know you think…
Can you love?

Yellow Eyes,Rayland Baxter,"

[Verse 1: Rayland Baxter]
There's a paperclip resting on my countertop
Sunday morning I forgot
What it's like to lose a friend
Yesterday, how it seemed so far away
And I've said all I can say

[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely

[Verse 2: Rayland Baxter]
Now I'm on the road
Knowing not which way to go
Is it yes or is it no?
I don't really care

For the golden sun
Has washed me away and I've become
Just another vagabond holding my head

[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely

[Bridge: Rayland Baxter]
All in all it's a beautiful day
When I wake up all alone I cannot help but run away
Now I'm afraid that it's all in my head
Don't you know that it's all in your head

[Verse 3: Rayland Baxter]
So you rolled the dice
Melt the fire burn the ice
Find the girl with yellow eyes and go and break her heart

See that nothing changes
And I know not what I've become
A prisoner to everyone I've loved from the start

[Chorus: Rayland Baxter]
Now it's time I get to going
Now it's time I get to find my own way
And I'll leave you lonely
I'll leave you lonely

Human,Of Monsters and Men,"

[Verse 1: Ragnar Þórhallsson]
When the words
Weigh heavy on the heart
I am lost
And led only by the stars

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna Bryndís Hilmarsdóttir, Ragnar]
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Breathe in, breathe out; let the human in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
Breathe in, breathe out and let it in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)

Plants awoke, and they slowly grow beneath the skin
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
So breathe in, breathe out; let the human in

[Verse 2: Ragnar]
The air is silk
Shadows form a grin
If I lose control
I feed the beast within

[Pre-Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

[Chorus: Nanna, Ragnar]
Breathe in, breathe out; let the human in

Breathe in, breathe out and let it in
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)

Plants awoke, and they slowly grow beneath the skin
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh oh)
So breathe in, breathe out; let the human in

Cage me like an animal
A crown with gems and gold
Eat me like a cannibal
Chase the neon throne

If I could only let go

Flapper Girl,The Lumineers,"

[Verse 1]
Cut off all of your hair
Did you flinch, did you care
Did he look, did he stop and stare
At your brand new hair
Local boy, local news
Power lines hangin boots
Firemen in their trucks cut loose
A local boy’s shoes
Cadillac, cadillac
Businessmen dressed in slacks
I’m gonna buy one for us when i get back
A big cadillac

[Bridge]

And I’ll never leave you again

And you can wave to all of your friends
And I’ll never leave you again

Would you write would you call back baby if
I wrote you a song

Heart's On Fire,Passenger,"

[Verse 1]
Well, I don't know how, and I don't why
But when something's living, you can't say die
You feel like laughing, but you start to cry
I don't know how, and I don't know why

Well, I don't have many, and I don't have much
In fact I don't have any, but I got enough
Cause I know those eyes, and I know that touch
I don't have many, and I don't have much

[Chorus]
But oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
For you

Well, I don't know where, and I don't when
But I know we'll be lovers again
I'll see you some day before the end
I don't know where, and I don't know when

But oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
Oh, darling, my heart's on fire
You know those love songs break your heart
You know those love songs break your heart

Drive,Glades,"

[Verse 1]
I'm caught up when you look at me
You let my heart breathe with ease
Chasing stars in our galaxy
Making our own make-believe
I want you when the sun goes low
Your body warmth wants me close
You say you're always by my side
'Til my blood runs dry

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

[Verse 2]
Freeze time when we align
Our love won't be confined
No way that the eye can hide
'Til my blood runs dry

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that I won't be the same without you
Don't let this moment slip away

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

[Bridge]
I close my eyes
I don't wanna escape
Let the tides rise in my heart

[Chorus]
I'll take you for a drive
Kiss me on the corner with your hand in mine
Ooh, say you love me too
Here to stay, you and I
Dancing in the colour of the golden light
Ooh, say you love me too
I'll give it to you

닫혀있지 Yeah, yeah
두드릴 테니 날 들여 보낼래?
감춰진 스릴을 줄게

[Pre-Chorus]
눈동자의 호기심에
이미 넌 빠져들었고
Don’t be afraid, love is the way
Shawty, I got it
You can call me monster

I’m creepin’ in your heart, babe
뒤집고 무너트리고 삼켜

죽어도 영원히 살래
Come here girl, you call me monster

She got me going crazy
(Oh yeah, she got me)
왜 심장이 뛰니?

그닥 온순하지 못해 (널 미워했어)
하지만 너를 원해
That’s right, my type

시작됐어 내 안에서
위험한 신호를 보내

모두 날 두려워해 So I’m untouchable man
근데 네 진심은 왜 결국에 날 거부 못해
숨어서 훔쳐보다가
깜짝 놀라지 (Who?)
네겐 안티노미 같은
난 네 존재의 일부 (How we do?)

[Verse 4]
날 그대로 받아들여
너의 두려운 걱정은 접어두렴
네가 견딜만한 고통을 누려
더 깊이 빠져들어

널 맘대로 가지고 놀아
내 손에서 맘껏 놀아
도망가지마 넌 영원히 맴돌아

This street is completely crazy
Strangers in between people
Every moment that we’re together
Like boom boom boom boom boom
What up

Hey girl, that one moment felt like eternity
(the fate-like moment)
When you pierced into me in just one moment
(like lightning, in this world)
You called my name and came to me

It’s amazing, like a flash of light
You fill me up the moment I see you, oh my
Sit here comfortably and listen to my story now

Oh I don’t care
Even if I have to go far
I’ll be the one man to be by your side

You seeped into my dry lips
And woke me up
The time’s wasting girl
So don’t wait, don’t wait too long

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
My heart grows bigger for you
And it closes its door for everyone else but you
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby, Call me baby, Call me baby
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl

You make me exist as myself
You’re the only one in my world
You’re the one, You’re the one
Girl you’re the one I want

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl

Baby girl, even among all the greed
And all the words
You showed that you believe in me

Even if everyone changes and leaves me
You are my lady
All I need is for you to hold my hand

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)
My heart grows bigger for you
And it closes its door for everyone else but you
(You know I’m here girl)
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby

I was once trapped in a dark maze
(in the darkness)
But I hear your voice that woke me up
You made me be born again
Yeah

E-X-O Listen!
Say my name (Louder)
If you become my light
And pull me through
This chaotic place (what up)
I’ll hold you and never change
I’ll hold you and face those who left me
Never don’t mind about a thing
You came into the big emptiness in my heart

In this shaking world (whoo babe)
You were the only one who became my light
Girl you’re the one I want
(You’re the one I want)

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
(You know my name girl)

(I’ll be your baby yeah- Ho!)
You make me exist as myself
(You know I’m here girl)
You’re the only one in my world
You’re the one, You’re the one
Girl you’re the one I want
(You’re the one that I want)

There are many who shine
But look at what’s real among them
Call me baby, Call me baby
Call me baby, Call me baby
Even if it’s many times, Call me girl

Run,BTS,"

방탄소년단의 Run 가사

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
넌 내 하나뿐인 태양 세상에 딱 하나
널 향해 피었지만 난 자꾸 목말라
너무 늦었어 늦었어 너 없이 살 순 없어
가지가 말라도 더 힘껏 손을 뻗어

[Verse 1: Suga]
손 뻗어봤자 금세 깨버릴 꿈 꿈 꿈
미칠 듯 달려도 또 제자리일 뿐 뿐 뿐
그냥 날 태워줘 그래 더 밀쳐내줘
이건 사랑에 미친 멍청이의 뜀박질

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
더 뛰게 해줘
나를 더 뛰게 해줘
두 발에 상처만 가득해도
니 얼굴만 보면 웃는 나니까

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
다시 Run Run Run 난 멈출 수가 없어
또 Run Run Run 난 어쩔 수가 없어
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해
다시 Run Run Run 넘어져도 괜찮아
또 Run Run Run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해
(Run)
Don’t tell me bye bye
(Run)
You make me cry cry
(Run)
Love is a lie lie
Don’t tell me, don’t tell me
Don’t tell me bye bye

[Verse 3: J-Hope]
다 끝난 거라는데 난 멈출 수가 없네
땀인지 눈물인지 나 더는 분간 못해 oh
내 발가벗은 사랑도 거친 태풍 바람도
나를 더 뛰게만 해 내 심장과 함께

[Pre-Chorus: V]
더 뛰게 해줘
나를 더 뛰게 해줘
두 발에 상처만 가득해도
니 얼굴만 보면 웃는 나니까

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
다시 Run Run Run 난 멈출 수가 없어
또 Run Run Run 난 어쩔 수가 없어
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해

다시 Run Run Run 넘어져도 괜찮아
또 Run Run Run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해

[Bridge: V, Jungkook, Jin, *Jimin*]
추억들이 마른 꽃잎처럼
산산이 부서져가
내 손 끝에서 내 발 밑에서
달려가는 네 등 뒤로
마치 나비를 쫓듯 꿈 속을 헤매듯
너의 흔적을 따라가
*길을 알려줘 날 좀 멈춰줘
날 숨쉬게 해줘*

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jimin]
다시 Run Run Run 난 멈출 수가 없어
또 Run Run Run 난 어쩔 수가 없어
어차피 이것밖에 난 못해
너를 사랑하는 것 밖엔 못해

다시 Run Run Run 넘어져도 괜찮아
또 Run Run Run 좀 다쳐도 괜찮아
가질 수 없다 해도 난 족해
바보 같은 운명아 나를 욕해

so far away,Agust D,"

[Intro: Agust D]
하고 싶은 게 없다는 게 진짜 뭣 같은데
흔한 꿈조차 없다는 게
한심한 거 알어 다 아는데
하란 대로만 하면 된다며
대학가면 다 괜찮아
그런 말들을 믿은
내가 병신이지 나 죽지 못해 살어

[Verse 1: Agust D]
술이나 좀 줘봐
오늘은 취하고 싶으니 제발 말리지 마
뭐든 좋아 백수 새끼가
술 마시는 건 사치지만
취하지도 않은 버틸 수가 없어
모두가 달리는데 왜 나만 여기 있어
모두가 달리는데 왜 나만 여기 있어
모두가 달리는데 왜 나만 여기서 있지

[Pre-Chorus: Suran]
So far away 나에게도 꿈이 있다면
날아가는 꿈이 있다면
Don’t fall away 나에게도 꿈이 있다면
날아가는 꿈이 있다면

[Chorus: Agust D]
Dream 그대의 창조와
삶의 끝에 함께 하리
Dream 그대의 자리가
어딜지라도 관대 하리
Dream 결국 시련의
끝에 만개하리
Dream 시작은 미약할지언정
끝은 창대하리

[Verse 2: Agust D]
그래 시발 죽지 못해서 살아
하고 싶은 게 없단 건 말야
무엇보다 괴로운데 외로운데 주변에선
하나 같이 정신차려 란
말뿐이네 화풀이해 상대는
뭐 나뿐인데 뭘 화풀이해
매일 아침에 눈 뜨는 게 숨 쉬는 게 무섭네

[Verse 3: Agust D]
친구와 가족 조차 멀어져만 가네
시간이 흐르면 흐를수록 더 조급하네
나 혼자인 기분 나 혼자인
지금 모든 게 사라졌음 해 신기루
처럼 사라졌음 해 사라 졌음
해 이젠 빌어 먹을 나조차도 사라졌음 해
이렇게 세상에 나 버려지네
그 순간 하늘과 멀어지네
떨어지네

[Pre-Chorus: Suran]
So far away 나에게도 꿈이 있다면
날아가는 꿈이 있다면
Don't fall away 나에게도 꿈이 있다면
날아가는 꿈이 있다면

[Chorus: Agust D]

The Last,Agust D,"

[Verse 1]
잘 나가는 아이돌 랩퍼 그 이면에
나약한 자신이 서 있어 조금 위험해
우울증 강박 때때로 다시금 도져
Hell no 어쩌면 그게 내 본 모습일 지도 몰라
Damn huh 현실의 괴리감
이상과의 갈등 아프네 머리가
대인기피증이 생겨 버린 게 18살쯤
그래 그때쯤 내 정신은 점점 오염 돼

[Verse 2]
가끔씩 나도 내가 무서워 자기 혐오와
다시 놀러 와 버린 우울증 덕분에
이미 민윤기는 죽었어 (내가 죽였어)
죽은 열정과 남과 비교하는 게 나의 일상이 되 버린 지 오래

[Verse 3]
정신과를 처음 간 날 부모님이 올라와
같이 상담을 받았지 부모님 왈 날 잘 몰라
나 자신도 날 잘 몰라 그렇다면 누가 알까
친구? 아님 너? 그 누구도 날 잘 몰라

[Bridge]
의사 선생님이 내게 물었어
주저 없이 나는 말했어 그런 적 있다고

[Hook]
버릇처럼 하는 말 uh I don’t give a shit, I don’t give a fuck
그딴 말들 전부다 uh 나약한 날 숨기려 하는 말
지우고픈 그때 그래 기억 조차 나지 않는 어느 공연하는 날
사람들이 무서워 화장실에 숨어 버린 나를 마주 하던 나

[Verse 4]
그때 난 그때 난
성공이 다 보상할 줄 알았지
근데 말야 근데 말야
시간이 지날 수록 괴물이 되는 기분야

[Verse 5]
청춘과 맞바꾼 나의 성공이란 괴물은 더욱 큰 부를 원해
무기였던 욕심이 되려 날 집어 삼키고 망치며 때론 목줄을 거네
어떤 이들은 내 입을 틀어 막으며 선악과를 삼키라 해
I don’t want it 그들은 내가 이 동산에서 나가길 원하네

[Verse 6]
Shit, shit 알겠으니까 제발 그만해
이 모든 일들의 근원은 나니까 나 스스로 그만둘게
내 불행이 니들의 행복이라면 기꺼이 불행 해줄게
증오의 대상이 나라면 기요틴에 올라서 줄게

[Verse 7]
상상만 하던 것이 현실이 돼 어릴 적 꿈이 내 눈앞에
꼴랑 두 명 앞에 공연하던 좆밥 이젠 도쿄돔이 내 코앞에
한번 사는 인생 누구보다 화끈하게 대충 사는 건 아무나 해
My fan my hommie my fam 걱정 말길 나 이젠 정말 괜찮아 damn

[Verse 8]
내 본질을 부정했던 게 수 차례
내 주소는 아이돌 부정은 안 해
수 차례 정신을 파고들던 고뇌
방황의 끝 정답은 없었네

[Verse 9]
팔아먹었다고 생각 했던 자존심이 이젠 나의 자긍심 돼
내 fan들아 떳떳이 고개들길 누가 나만큼 해 uh

[Hook]
세이코에서 롤렉스 악스에서 체조
내 손짓 한번에 끄덕거리는 수 만 명들의 고개
Show me the money 못 한게 아니라 안 한 거라고 shit
우릴 팔아먹던 너넨 안 한 게 아니라 못 한 거라고 shit

[Verse 10]
내 창작의 뿌리는 한 세상 단맛 쓴맛 똥맛까지 다 봤지
화장실 바닥에 잠을 청하던 그땐 이젠 내게 추억이네 uh 추억이 돼
배달 알바 중 났던 사고 덕분에 시발 박살이 났던 어깨
부여잡고 했던 데뷔 너네가 누구 앞에서 고생한 척들을 해

[Hook]
세이코에서 롤렉스 악스에서 체조
내 손짓 한번에 끄덕거리는 수 만 명들의 고개
한이 낳은 나 uh 똑똑히 나를 봐 uh
우릴 팔아먹던 너넨 안 한 게 아니라 못 한 거라고 shit

Heaven,Warrant,"

I've got a picture of your house
And you`re standing by the door
It`s black and white and faded
And it`s looking pretty worn

See the factory that I worked
Silhouetted in the back
The memories are gray
But man, they`re really coming back
I don`t need to be the king of the world
As long as I`m the hero of this little girl

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We`ll find a way

How I love the way you move
And the sparkle in your eyes
There`s a color deep inside them
Like a blue surburban sky

When I come home late at night
And you`re in bed asleep
I wrap my arms around you
So I can feel you breathe
I don`t need to be a superman, ah ah
As long as you will always be my biggest fan

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
We`ll find a way

Now the lights are going out
Along the boulevard
The memories come rushing back
And it makes it pretty hard

I`ve got nowhere left to go
And no one really cares
I don`t know what to do
But I`m never giving up on you

Heaven isn`t too far away
Closer to it every day
No matter what your friends might say
Yeah, we`re gonna find a way

Heaven
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh
Heaven
Whoa oh, oh, oh, oh oh

Heaven
It`s not too far away
Eh yeah
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away
It`s not too far away

If I Had A Boat,Lyle Lovett,"

If I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

If I were Roy Rogers
I'd sure enough be single
I couldn't bring myself to marrying old Dale
It'd just be me and Trigger
We'd go riding through them movies
Then we'd buy a boat and on the sea we'd sail

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

The mystery masked man was smart
He got himself a Tonto
Cause Tonto did the dirty work for free
But Tonto he was smarter
And one day said Kemosabe
Kiss my ass I bought a boat
I'm going out to sea

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat

And if I were like lightning
I wouldn't need no sneakers
I'd come and go wherever I would please
And I'd scare 'em by the shade tree
And I'd scare 'em by the light pole
But I would not scare my pony on my boat out on the sea

And if I had a boat
I'd go out on the ocean
And if I had a pony
I'd ride him on my boat
And we could all together
Go out on the ocean
Me upon my pony on my boat
Me upon my pony on my boat

Wake Up, we're going to the country
We're going to the country and we'll do it right
Cook up some sweet potatoes and tomorrow night
We'll watch the stars dancing with the satellite

Yer country loving gets me off all right
Yer country loving is complete
Yer country loving gets me off all right
Yer country loving is so sweet

Wake Up, wake up we're in the country

Gravity's Gone,Drive-By Truckers,"

I went stumbling through the fog trying to find a reason for the things I told her
She woke up sunny side down and I was still thinking I was too proud to flip her over
Between the champagne hand jobs and the kissin' ass by everyone involved
Cocaine rich comes quick and that's why the small dicks have it all

So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floatin'

Those little demons ain't the reasons for the bruises on your soul you've been neglecting
You'll never lose your mind as long as your heart always reminds you where you left it
And don't ever let them make you feel like saying what you want is unbecoming
If you were supposed to watch your mouth all the time I doubt your eyes would be above it

So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floatin'

Between the champagne hand jobs and the kissing ass by everyone involved
What used to be is gone and what ought to be ought not to be so hard

So I'll meet you at the bottom if there really is one
They always told me when you hit it you'll know it
But I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floatin'
I've been falling so long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floatin'
I've been falling too long it's like gravity's gone and I'm just floatin'

L.A. Freeway,Jerry Jeff Walker,"

Pack up all your dishes
Make note of all good wishes
Say goodby to the landlord for me
That sum-bitch has always bored me
Throw out them old LA papers
And that moldy box of vanilla wafers
Adios to all this concrete
Gonna get me some dirt road back street

[Chorus]
If I can just get off of that L.A. freeway
Without getting killed or caught
Down that road in a cloud of smoke
For some land that I ain't bought bought bought
If I can just get off of that L.A. freeway

Here's to you old skinny Dennis
Only one I think I will miss
I can hear your Bassman singin'
Sweet and low like a gift your bringin'
Play it for me one more time now
Got to give it all we can now
I beleive everything your saying
Just keep on keep on playing

Chorus

Put the pink slip in the mailbox
Leave the key in the old front door lock
They will find it likely as not
With all the things that we have forgot
Oh Susanna now don't you cry, babe
Love's a gift that's surely handmade
We've got something to believe in
Before you know it's time we're leavin'

"
So High - Single Version,John Legend,"

Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies what love could really be
Let's go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of a cloud we're floating away

Ooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky

Maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And can't get much closer to god then where we are
We'll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating way

Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky

Oooh, yeah
Ooooo-ooh oh
Oooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're soo high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
My shoes are scraping the sky
Ooooh yeeaah
Mmmhaaaah ay
Yeah...

Lifetime - Uncut,Maxwell,"

I was reborn when I was broken
I wouldn't believe, I wouldn't believe, no
Been through a storm, no use in hoping
That you would come rescue me
Somehow your love set me free

[Chorus:]
And I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time
I can let it all pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime, lifetime

There was a time when love wasn't chosen
Now I'm just open for more
Now I'm just reaching out for something better
Than I had before, girl
There ain't a bottom line in your world

Ooh and I, I can let my life pass me by
Or I can get down and try
Work it all out this lifetime
Work it on out this time

I can let it all pass me by
Or I can just try and try
I can move to the light
Oh if I take it one day at a time (oh I)
Oh spread my love out and fly
Oh I (I can move to the light)
Ooh I can just make you understand
That love is not a fairytale in a melody
If you want it you can have it girl
Maybe you will see, maybe you will see (ooh ooh)
Ooh oh oh whoa oh
Lifetime, lifetime

Heaven - A Cappella feat. Pusha T of Clipse,John Legend,"

Ooh, I promise not to do it again
I promise not to do it

You can't say I don't love you
Just because I cheat on you
'Cuz you can't see all I do
To keep you from knowing the things I do

Like erase my phone and keep it out of town
I keep it strapped up when I sleep around
Well I should have known one day you'd find out
But you can't go and leave me now

You know that I love you
There's no one above you
I said it the last time
But this is the last time

Don't make me over
'Cuz I can be faithful
Baby, you're my number one
You're my number one

Now, who is she? What's her name?
You don't need to know about everything
We fight about this, we fight about that
You hang up the phone and call me right back

Well I'll never be something I'm not
Please don't throw away what we've got
'Cuz we've been together for way too long
I was playing around but I'm coming home

You know that I love you
(Know that I love you)
There's no one above you
(No one above you)
I said it the last time
(Hey, hey)
But this is the last time

Don't make me over
(Don't leave me baby
'Cuz I can be faithful
(You know I try)
Baby, you're my number one
(Baby)
You're my number one

I keep you laced up so you ain't gotta borrow nothing
From them broke ass friends who be bargain hunting
They say they shop on Ebay, baby why is they frontin'?
They be on the internet but they never cop nothin'

I keep you in girl, what is those on your toes?
And your neck staying froze off that rose colored gold
I suppose you was told by them hoes I was cheatin'
Thinkin' my heart don't got nothing to do with my penis

He got a mind of his own and he just be saying shit
And I don't wanna cheat but I don't be saying shit
I try to jack off, he ask me, ""Who is you playin' wit?""
But I know he love you, he told me you was his favorite

You know that I love you
(Know that I love you)
There's no one above you
(No one above you)
I said it the last time
(Said it the last time)
But this is the last time

Baby you're my number one
(Oh baby)

Came in the Range Rover
Left with a hangover

For Lovers Only - Uncut,Maxwell,"

This ain't for the ones
That just love for fun
That just love and run
That just hold the gun

This is for those that bleed
That want but have no need
This ain't for the war

For lovers only
Lovers only, yeah
Strictly for the lovers only
Who are lost and lonely

Ever since the way you looked at me
Love is not a want, love is now a need

This is if you want to hold me
Or for lovers only
Not for the easy
This ain't 'bout that style
It's about a take it day by day
It's about a wait that's worth it baby

Love came (love came, love came) forever...

Stay With You,John Legend,"

[Verse 1]
We've been together for a while now
We're growing stronger everyday now
It feels so good and there's no doubt
I will stay with you as each morning brings sunrise
And the flowers bloom in springtime
On my love you can rely
And I'll stay with you

[Chorus]
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you

[Verse 2]
Though relationships can get old
They have the tendency to grow cold
We have something like a miracle
Yeah, and I'll stay with you

[Chorus]
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright

And there will be heartaches and pains, yes it will
But through it all, we will remain
In this life, we all know
Friends may come, and they may go
Through the years I know
I will stay
And in the end I know that we'll find
Love so beautiful and divine
We'll be lovers for a lifetime, yeah
And I'll stay with you
I will stay with you

You & I (Nobody in the World) - R3hab Remix - Radio Edit,John Legend,"

You fix your make up, just so
Guess you don't know, that your beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago

If your mirror won't make it any clearer I'll
Be the one to let you know

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I

You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on everybody staring
Tell all of these boys, they wasting their time
Stop standing in line, cause your all mine

And this evening I, won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world

You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try

You don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try

Out of all the girls
You my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight

All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and i

Mary Jane's Last Dance,Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,"

[Verse 1]
She grew up in an Indiana town
Had a good lookin' mama who never was around
But she grew up tall and she grew up right
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen
I was introduced and we both started groovin'
She said, ""I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on
Keep movin' on""

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

[Verse 2]
Well, I don't know, but I've been told
You never slow down, you never grow old
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down
Tired of myself, tired of this town

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
Honey, put on that party dress
Buy me a drink, sing me a song
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

[Verse 3]
There's pigeons down on Market Square
She's standin' in her underwear
Lookin' down from a hotel room
The nightfall will be comin' soon

[Refrain]
Oh, my, my, oh, hell yes
You got to put on that party dress
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone
I hit my last number and walked to the road

[Chorus]
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again

"
House Party,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
You're on the couch, blowing up my phone
You don't want to come out, but you don't want to be alone
It don't take but two to have a little soiree
If you're in the mood, sit tight right where you are, babe

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, girl, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Verse 3]
Throw a neon t-shirt over the lamp shade
I'll take the furniture, slide it out of the way
Shaking the floor, rattling the roof
We'll go to town right there in your living room

[Chorus]
Let's have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

[Bridge]
So I'll be at your door in ten minutes
Whatever you got on, baby, stay in it
You ain't gotta leave the house to have a good time
I'ma bring the good time home to you

[Chorus]
We'll have a house party, we don't need nobody
Turn your TV off, break that boombox out
We'll wake up all the neighbors til the whole block hates us
And the cops will show up and try to shut us down

If you're gonna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party
If you wanna be a homebody
We're gonna have a house party

Something I Need,OneRepublic,"

[Verse 1: OneRepublic]
I had a dream the other night
About how we only get one life
It woke me up right after two
I stayed awake and stared at you
So I wouldn’t lose my mind
And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you could tell
But you’re like the net under the ledge
When I go flying off the edge
You go flying off as well

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Verse 2: OneRepublic]
Last night I think I drank too much
Yeah, call it our temporary crutch
With broken words I tried to say
Honey don’t you be afraid
If we got nothing, we got us

[Pre Chorus: OneRepublic]
And if you only die once
I wanna die with

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

[Bridge: OneRepublic]
I know that we’re not the same
But I'm so damn glad that we made it to this time
This time now

[Chorus: OneRepublic]
You got something I need
In this world full of people there’s one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you

Lord, kill me If I don't preach the gospel
I'm still in my twenties, but I'll die if I got to
Eh man, I'm already dead, man, forget my flesh
I done been crossed over, see the full court press
I'm a full court mess if the Lord don't use me
Running from my trials thinkin' everything's groovy
If the cross don't move me then I don't wanna breath no more
If I ain't seeing Christ, partner, I don't wanna see no more
Rep Him every day without worrying about a bruising
I been to China, man, I seen some real persecution
If you didn't know Christ, would your life look the same?
Can they tell you value Jesus by the way you rep his name?
Man, what's the point of living if I'm living for myself?
Lord, empty out my life before I put you on the shelf
So for God, I go hard, I don't wanna die tonight
But there's too many people living who ain't heard about the Christ

Went to Asia had to duck and hide for sharin' my faith
They tell me ""Water it down"" when I get back to states
They say ""Tone the music down, you might sell a lot of records, but it's people out here dying and none of 'em heard the message""
Took my wifey on mission trip in Central America
Shared her testimony, 40 people stood and stared at her
When she said Jesus, should have seen, it was insane
Cause 40 out of 40 never heard of Jesus name
Oh man, we ain't focused on the war we just kickin' it
Worried bout our image and our space up on the internet
Take me out the game coach I don't wanna play no mo
If can't give it all I got and leave it out there on the court
Thank you for the Grace for the will and the desire
Got me living for your glory stead of living to retire
But I pray I'll never tire of going hard for Messiah
I don't need no motivation, You the reason I'm inspired

That's what that is baby, that what that mean, that what that mean
That what That is baby, That what that mean, that what that mean
Wha-What that mean?
That mean that we, should be out up in the streets
Not just in houses with our bible's summarizing what we read
Man this ain't deep (man this ain't deep), why we ain't doing what we read
Its like we sleep (its like we sleep)
But sinners sleepwalk when they sleep
So why can't we (so why can't we), the redeemed of the LORD
Act out, what He said, and make a scene for the LORD
Action-cut, say what, like we was the director
But you better get a Grip like movie sets, and get to stepping (Martin)
I know you done it da-done it, da-done-and heard it all
You was going hard for the Lord before you heard this song
But don't play yourself to save ya self and walk in fear

Take Your Time,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
I don't know if you were looking at me or not
You probably smile like that all the time
And I don't mean to bother you but
I couldn't just walk by
And not say hi
And I know your name
'Cause everybody in here knows your name
And you're not looking for anything right now
So I don't wanna come on strong
Don't get me wrong
Your eyes are so intimidating
My heart is pounding but
It's just a conversation
No girl, I'm not wasted
You don't know me
I don't know you but I want to

[Chorus]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just want to take your time
I don't wanna wreck your Friday
I ain't gonna waste my lines
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

[Verse 2]
And I know it starts with hello
And the next thing you know you're try to be nice
And some guys getting too close
Trying to pick you up
Trying to get you drunk
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cause she's supposed to save you from random guys
That talk too much and wanna stay too long
It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it well
You could've rolled your eyes
Told me to go to hell
Could've walked away
But you're still here
And I'm still here
Come on let's see where it goes

[Chorus 2]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't have to meet your mother
We don't have to cross that line
I don't wanna steal your covers
I just wanna take your time

[Bridge]
I don't wanna go home with you
I just wanna be alone with you

[Chorus 3]
I don't wanna steal your freedom
I don't wanna change your mind
I don't have to make you love me
I just wanna take your time
I don't wanna blow your phone up
I just wanna blow your mind
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time
No, I ain't gotta call you baby
And I ain't gotta call you mine
I don't have to take your heart
I just wanna take your time

Leave The Night On,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
They roll the sidewalks in this town, all up after the sun goes down
They say nothin' good happens here when midnight rolls around
But layin' down would be in vain, I can't sleep with you on my brain
And I ain't anywhere close to tired
Your kiss has got me wired

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Verse 2]
Now all the stars are turnin' blue, just kissed the clock 2:22
Baby, I know what you're wishin' for, I'm wishin' for it too
Now all the lights are flashin' gold, nobody cares how fast we go
Our soundtrack's in the stereo
The DJ's on a roll

[Chorus]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally again
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Bridge]
The sun'll steal the magic from us soon
So let's take one more trip around the moon

[Chorus 2]
Girl, you got the beat right, killin' in your Levis
High on your love has got me buzzin' like a streetlight
It's still early out in Cali, baby, don't you wanna rally
We'll find a road with no name, lay back in the slow lane
The sky is dropping Jupiter all around us like some old Train
We'll be rolling down the windows, I bet you we're catchin' our second wind
We don't have to go home, we can leave the night on
We can leave the night on
We can leave the night on

[Outro]
Buzzin' like a streetlight
We can leave 'em on tonight

Break Up In A Small Town,Sam Hunt,"

[Spoken Verse 1]
I knew I'd see her around
I'd be at some party, she'd show up and I'd be walking out
Or across some parking lot hiding behind her sister
I'd look up, she'd be at the red light beside me
In that white Maxima with the sticker on the back
I'd act like I didn't see her
We'd pay at the same pumps
Flip through the same stations
And slow down for the same curves
Run around with the same crowds
We just needed some time
She could get on with her life and I'd get on with mine
Thought I would be fine, heh, but maybe not
I knew she'd find a way to get over me
But I'd never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Spoken Verse 2]
For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
But now it's like these county lines are closing in on me
I see 'em everywhere together
And it's hitting a little too close to home
She's so far gone, but she didn't go far
She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
She's leaving those same marks in someone else's yard
In someone else's arms right down the road
And I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
Like they don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

[Bridge]
Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
And I drive into town sometimes I see you sittin' there with him
And I wanna jump out
I wanna fight
I wanna say, ""... that guy!"" but I can't
It's my fault, I let her go
I never thought that...

[Chorus]
She would get down with somebody I know
I guess that's just how it goes
When you break up in a small town
I see our friends and they put on a show
They don't want me to know
So they give me the go-around
But there's only so many streets, so many lights
I swear it's like I can't even leave my house
I should've known all along
You gotta move or move on
When you break up in a small town

Make You Miss Me,Sam Hunt,"

[Verse 1]
You hear a new song, it's your favorite
But pretty soon you'll be changing the station
And all your old shoes are looking brand new
They wanna be worn but they never get the chance to
Heavy into everything, ready for the next thing
To catch your eye for a while than you're over it
You change your mind on it
Soon as the shine's gone
Like you always do, but you don't know it yet but

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me

[Verse 2]
You're cold and hot
You burn out like a match
Keep the slip knot in the strings you attach
You think it's easy, but that's a lie
The only reason that you're good at goodbye is
Every boy you've ever met, was too easy to forget
Well, I ain't going out like that

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you wish that you were sleeping in my shirt
Lie about my jacket and tell everyone it's yours
When your phone rings after midnight and you're thinking maybe it's me
Gonna make you miss me
Whoa, whoa
I ain't gonna be that easy to leave
Whoa, whoa
Girl, I'm gonna make you miss me

[Bridge]
Writing letters that you're never gonna mail
Stay up and paint my favorite shade of red on your nails
'Cause you can't fall asleep and you're wishing you were with me
I'm gonna make you miss me
Make you miss me
Make you miss the way my hand fit in your hand
When you're dialing my number listening to my favorite bands
I'll say baby you know all you can say
Is come and get me

[Outro]
Gonna make you miss me
I'm gonna make you miss me
And oh, oh, oh
I'm gonna make you miss me

And how I’m gon’ respect you if your pockets broke?
On your rap sheet a whole lot of bros
It’s a clinic on Western but you outta go
You’re broke, your pussy stink, you borrow clothes
Lost the little ass that you had playin’ with your nose

Swear I got cash and started actin’ like a asshole
Catch up, keep up, Cutlass with the beat up

Throw it up chunky — wrists on chunky

And I ain’t used to what you used to
The only thing in your ear is a Bluetooth
You niggas ain’t blinged-out, 20 racks I blow that
5-10-15 I let my niggas hold that

Don’t talk to me, get your bread up

Too Rich For The Bitch,50 Cent,"

[Produced by London On Da Track]

[Intro]
That bitch there a door knob, nigga, we all get a turn
Fuck you catching feelings for? I mean when your ass'll learn?
That pussy community, community

[Verse 1]
While you be all in her DM, nigga
I be all in that BM with her
You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like ""when I see him I'mma kill this nigga""
I'm on three-way like, ""you hear this nigga?""
I should take the bitch back and clip the nigga
Pussy make him not pay attention
You punk bitch go with this nigga
I throw bands, bitch, these hoes love me
I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
I’m like, ""now what you think of me?""
Niggas goin’ out just to talk to these hoes
Blowin’ big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone
I don't do no stalkin'
I don't cuff no hoes, tell a bitch keep walkin'
I don't do much talkin'
Right now I'm flossin', I do this often
Gotta flex on a bitch
Tag team, I got next on a bitch (I got next)
I ain't stressing a bitch
But every now and then I blow a check on a bitch

[Hook]
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)
Now do it, baby, do it, baby (do it, do it)
Do it, baby, do it (yeah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Shawty playin', she lame for that
She ain't have to put a nigga name in that
Beefin' over these bitches, not me
Nah, nigga, I ain't came for that
We don't talk to no pillows, nigga
We brought all these bitches with us
You act like you got all the hoes
But all I see is niggas with you
She don't like when you pullin' on her
She like me, I'm pullin' up
I act like I don't want her
You act like you can't get enough
That bitch there like dopeboys
If you got money she goin' for it
I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, ""oh lawd""
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford
She take pictures with your money
But you tell her she can't do it
All you niggas don't panic
I'm just tryna understand it
I must take these hoes for granted
Or you niggas just so romantic

[Hook]
Drop that ho back off in her hood, too rich for the bitch
I'm too rich for the bitch, I'm too rich for the bitch
Drop that ho back off at that club, I'm too rich for the bitch

Cali Sunshine,The Game,"

California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time

[Verse 1: The Game]
Last year Jazze Pha got stuck up inside the Grand Lux
The most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up
Any rapper can get touched, any bitch can get fucked
Under the California sun, impalas and big trucks
They say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap
Cause your body might wash up by the courts of Venice Beach
Ain't shit sweet but my swisher, ain't shit buzzin but my liquor
Cali chickens go to the Ada strip and come back a little thicker
With more ass than Delicious, that's my Flavor of Love
We make it rain like Rain Man when he played with the glove
I'm the King to you pawn niggas, Punisher, Spawn niggas
Playing in green, Paul Pierce to you LeBron niggas
We done barbeque, front and back lawn niggas
Summer Jam, throw your ass off stage, Akon niggas
We drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm nigga
Take that Champion hoodie off in the California Sunshine

[Hook: Bilal]
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm in my drop top Phantom, down Wilshire Boulevard
We can't find Biggie's killers so we gave Puffy a star
And I'm by far, Hollywood Boulevard
But I'm from a boulevard that taught y'all how to shoot out of moving cars
Remember ""New Jersey Drive"" was like an east coast menace
And ""Belly"" was like the sequel without O-Dog in it
Give me a New York minute
To show you Cali got more dead bodies than the Yankees got New York pennants
Cause we Dodgers in Impalas with the windows tinted
I duck shots where Venus and Serena used to play tennis
And they never came back like throwing a boomerang flat
See me I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat
It's like a scene from a movie, when the screen fade black
Niggas roll up on you, now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap
If you slipping in Hollywood and you get your chain snatched
I know some niggas that owe some niggas, I'll get your chain back

[Hook: Bilal]
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time
California sunshine, in the summer time

[Verse 3: The Game]
Niggas already know who had the marijuana first
We birthdays in sour diesel, I was there when the water burst
Hell naw we don't surf, we halfway go to church
Tell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in a fucking hearse
And it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt
But it is your day to get buried by a verse
It'll be another 10 years 'fore you see a MC Ren here
Where he been I've been there, that Lambo I'm in there
Hotter than the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there
Top off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swimwear
So listen I'm so sincere, 'bout to work out like gym wear
Murder MTV's Top 10 and tat my face with ten tears
That's ten funerals, ten caskets
Ten three-piece Ralph Lauren suits, ten motorbikes stopping traffic
And ten reasons why I got California hotter than acid
Don't you ever ever leave me off the Top 10, you fucking bastards

Good girls, they be in church!

You ain't bout that life (bout that life)

You don't bounce that ass like, ""Oh Lord!""
Then climb back up the pole to meet Christ

Gotta sheriff here and a baliff here, all we missin is a judge
One night with a random bitch, and she'll burn your ass like a rug
Real niggas gon' say that, real niggas don't play that
Real nigga'll take a basic bitch, then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin the best of you, gotta pull a ho outta that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a ho she got baptized

Then she turned around, lookin like Morris Chestnut
Aww, hell no, God damn. What the fuck?
Even though shit a nigga still might fuck
You can be my ""Plan C,"" just in case my ""A"" and ""B"" can't cut
Guess what? A nigga so fresh to death, I'm decomposin'
I just copped a dope ass condo, just to keep some hoes in
What I'm gon' do with all these racks?
Damn, what she gonna do with all that ass?
That baby oil is Holy Water
Ever met a young nigga with too much cash?
Her baby daddy live by my words
Damn, she cold, she got them curves

And our days go by
And I never needed you
And our days go by
And I never needed you

[Verse 1]
And I worked so hard
And I killed myself
And you broke my bones
And I sold my soul

But now days go by
And I never needed you
But now days go by
And I never needed you

And I could have been your mother
And I could have been your sister
Be your twin brother
I just wanted to be

And our days go by
And I never needed you

Confess your kiss
Still knocks me off my legs
First time I saw you
Was like a punch right through my chest
I will forever cause you'll forever be
My one true broken heart
Pieces inside of me
And you forever my baby

[Chorus]
You will rest your head
Your strength wants saving
And when you wake
You will fly away
Holding tight to the legs of all your angels
Goodbye my love into your blue blue eyes
In your blue blue world
You're my baby blue

Confess I'm not quite ready to be left
Still I know I did my level best
You give, you give
To this I can attest
You made me, you made me
You and me forever baby

You and me forever

When your day is done and you got to run, cocaine

You Never Can Tell,Chuck Berry,"

[Verse 1]
It was a teenage wedding
And the old folks wished them well
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle
And now the young monsieur and madame
Have rung the chapel bell

[Hook]
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 2]
They furnished off an apartment with
A two room Roebuck sale
The coolerator was crammed with
TV dinners and ginger ale
But when Pierre found work, the little money comin' worked out well

[Hook]
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 3]
They had a hi-fi phono, boy
Did they let it blast
Seven hundred little records,
All rock, rhythm and jazz
But when the sun went down
The rapid tempo of the music fell

[Hook]
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

[Verse 4]
They bought a souped-up jitney, was a cherry red '53
And drove it down Orleans
To celebrate their anniversary
It was there where Pierre was wedded to the lovely madamoiselle

[Hook]
""C'est la vie"", say the old folks
It goes to show you never can tell

They had a teenage wedding

Give me, I said give me my thing
Oh God, give me my thing
